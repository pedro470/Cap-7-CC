The [color index="280AA02D1400"]medical examiner system[color index="800000"]—[%p]
This system allows for an examination, or in some cases, an autopsy, to determine the cause of death in accidents, or when a person has died from disease or an unknown cause.[%p]
The work of the medical examiner is done as follows.[%p]
In the event of an unusual death, the forensic officer first conducts an examination, which is followed by a [color index="280AA02D1400"]postmortem[color index="800000"] from the medical examiner.[%p]
If the cause of death can be determined, the body is then turned over to the family.[%p]
If the postmortem examination fails to determine the cause of death, only then does the examiner conduct an autopsy.[%p]
And if it is judged that a crime was involved, a further, more expansive judicial autopsy is conducted[...] but such an autopsy had already been performed on Watabe Tomoaki.[%p]
It was extremely unusual for a second autopsy, like this one, to be performed.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Well?”[%p]
Shinjo averted his eyes from the coroner's knife.[%p]
He'd been to many judicial autopsies, but it was something he'd never gotten used to. He probably never would, he thought.[%p]
As for the person standing next to the coroner[...] she was staring at the open skull without the slightest trace of disgust.[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“As I suspected, I'm seeing signs of enlargement.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Enlargement? Of the brain?”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“What else? Did you think I could look at his skull and tell you if his internal organs had enlarged?”[%p]
Shinjo's shoulders slumped a little.[%p]
When he'd first met her, he'd been unsure of how to handle her, but now he actually felt kind of worried for her. Didn't that get tiring after a while?[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“From what you said before, the cause of death was definitely suffocation.”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“Suffocation alone wouldn't be enough to do this to you.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Which means that it's the same as the other victims, huh? Any idea as to the cause?”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“There's just not enough samples. Is it something unique to the victims, or is it something common to all Gigalomaniacs?”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“You don't know, huh?”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“There's a way to find out, though.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“We can open up the skulls of Miyashiro Takuru and Arimura Hinae. That will tell us whether or not it's something that all Gigalomaniacs have in common.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“D-Don't be stupid. We can't do that.”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“I'm joking. We've got CRT scans and MRIs now. There's no need to chop open their skulls.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“What? Is it so surprising that I would tell a joke?”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“N-No[...]”[%p]
Shinjo thought to himself that she probably wasn't joking.[%p]
She didn't like Gigalomaniacs. She hated them.[%p]
And from the bottom of her heart.[%p]
He didn't know why she despised them so much.[%p]
Of course, there was probably a good reason for it[...] but he wished she would tone it down a bit.[%p]
They probably didn't become Gigalomaniacs by choice[...] and more than anything, he didn't want to lose their help with the case.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“So[...] what's the plan for the investigation now?”[%p]
If there were still test subjects under the hospital, there were things the police could do.[%p]
But when he'd gone down there, there wasn't a trace of anything left.[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“We've got evidence if we need it, though, right?”[%p]
Kunosato's voice was as cold as ever.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Evidence?”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“Why do you think I brought that girl out of there? Make her tell you everything she knows.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Come on, she's a kid.”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“She's not a kid. She's a dangerous Gigalomaniac.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“[...]Hahh[...]”[%p]
Shinjo rubbed his temples, unsure of what to say.[%p]
