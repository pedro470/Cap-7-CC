Shinjo had given me the location of an office in a multipurpose building in Sakuragaokacho.[%p]
There were rows of desks there, stacked high with paper that I normally would’ve considered a cornucopia of information.[%p]
But I didn’t have time to worry about them now.[%p]
I rushed up to Shinjo as soon as I saw him.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“She’s gone? Was she kidnapped? How could that happen with the police here?”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“No, like I said on the phone, that’s not it—”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“But it’s true that she’s missing, right?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“T-Takuru, stop it! What’s gotten into you?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Oh[...] yeah. Sorry.”[%p]
Yamazoe Uki had reminded me a little too much of Minamisawa Senri, and I’d lost control of myself.[%p]
Kurusu quickly moved to stop me.[%p]
By the way, Kurusu had come to keep an eye on me. In her words, to make sure I didn’t do anything stupid.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Anyway, it wasn’t a kidnapping. She just suddenly disappeared.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“But doesn’t that mean she was kidnapped?”[%p]
[name]Momose[line]“No way. Shinjo, Mio, and I were all here at the time.”[%p]
Momose, the CEO of Freesia, had been looking confused and concerned ever since I’d arrived.[%p]
When I’d first met her the night we snuck into AH Tokyo General, she’d seemed like a loud, boisterous sort of woman[...] but now she felt kind of tired.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“We sat her on the sofa while the rest of us talked over here. And then we looked at the sofa and she was gone.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Are you sure she didn’t just go to the bathroom?”[%p]
Kurusu pointed at the toilets in the back.[%p]
But Shinjo put his hand on his forehead, thinking, and said,[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“That was the first place we looked. But she’s nowhere to be found[...] in fact, there’s no sign that she even opened the doors or windows.”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“There’s only one possibility. She’s a Gigalomaniac, so she used her power to escape.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Her power?”[%p]
Come to think of it, I still hadn’t asked.[%p]
What power did Yamazoe Uki have?[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Teleportation, or something like that?”[%p]
Kunosato whispered an answer, her voice full of hate, without even bothering to look back at me.[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“I don’t know.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“You don’t know?”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Yeah. She barely answered any of our questions. Kunosato tried to ask her about her power, but didn’t get anywhere.”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“If it was teleportation, she would’ve left a long time ago. But she didn’t.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Uki is a little special. And that’s what got us.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Special?”[%p]
[name]Momose[line]“I’ve been thinking that maybe we should turn her over to an orphanage.”[%p]
[name]Momose[line]“And I was just talking with Shinjo and Mio, and they both gladly agreed.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“I didn’t agree.”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“Neither did I.”[%p]
[name]Momose[line]“Shut up. You’re just making things complicated.”[%p]
Momose motioned for them to be quiet.[%p]
[name]Momose[line]“Ahem, so anyway, they agreed. And I took Uki down to the parking lot and tried to get her in the car. I know someone who runs a facility like that, and I wanted to visit them.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Then you were the one who took her away.”[%p]
So why was everyone upset that she’d disappeared?[%p]
Momose had taken her outside. There was no mystery there.[%p]
As Kurusu and I stood there with our mouths hanging open, Shinjo interrupted.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“At least, that’s how it went in her dream.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh? Her dream?”[%p]
[name]Momose[line]“No, it really happened. I can remember the sensation of her hand, and the rumble in the car when the engine started. It was all real.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“But the moment you tried to get Uki in the car, you came back to reality, right? And then you were in your office, talking with us.”[%p]
[name]Momose[line]“Yes[...] that’s right.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“We never spoke about any kind of orphanage, and we never saw you leave. You were here talking the whole time. I’m sure of it.”[%p]
[name]Momose[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“But Uki disappeared from the room suddenly.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Um, what do you mean? I don’t understand.”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“I think that’s her power. Once we capture her, I’ll look into it again.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]!”[%p]
Kunosato’s use of the word “capture” pissed me off.[%p]
I could tell that, like Arimura said, she didn’t even think of us as humans. But she didn’t have to talk that way about a little girl, did she?[%p]
Even if she didn’t like psychics, did she have to go that far?[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
I glared at her, but Kunosato didn’t seem bothered in the slightest.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“As for where she went, if you two don’t know, there’s only one possibility.”[%p]
[name]Momose[line]“I was just thinking the same thing.”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“Which means that life’s about to get a little tough[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Wh-What do you mean?”[%p]
Shinjo answered me with a bitter sigh.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“A place you know well. Her old home.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“What? You can’t mean[...]”[%p]
[name]Momose[line]“No[...] Uki kept insisting she had to go home, you know?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“But that place was Hell. Why?”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“I couldn’t say. Anyway, we need to get her back before things turn into even more of a mess.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Takuru[...] Hey, Takuru?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Shh. What if they catch us?”[%p]
An hour had passed since we’d first spoken to Momose at Freesia.[%p]
Kurusu and I were hiding behind some plants near AH Tokyo General.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“You have to let them handle this. If we amateurs screw this up[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“That’s not happening. I’m finding Yamazoe Uki and taking her back to Aoba Dorm.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“What? Wh-Why?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I’m not letting Kunosato have her.”[%p]
I was gritting my teeth hard in anger.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Takuru?”[%p]
Afterward, Shinjo, Momose, and Kunosato had started to come up with a plan to get inside the basement of the hospital.[%p]
Of course, they weren’t going to let us come along. We were told to go home, and at first, that was my plan.[%p]
But then things changed.[%p]
Kunosato said that she wasn’t sending Yamazoe Uki to an orphanage, but to a research center she was affiliated with.[%p]
She’d said that they were going to research her power there. But Kunosato had treated not only Arimura and I, but also little Uki, as nothing more than guinea pigs.[%p]
And I’d heard her use the word “capture” many times.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](She’s finally free from those terrible experiments and out of that awful basement!)[%p]
Was Kunosato going to send her right back to the same old life she’d experienced before?[%p]
Just imagining it terrified me. And it made me come to a decision.[%p]
—I would save her.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“If I abandoned her here[...] I’d be doing the exact same thing I did before. I’d be abandoning someone again in the same exact place.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“[...]?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“A long time ago, I abandoned your friend Minamisawa Senri here, and I ran away. I still regret that to this day.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“That Yamazoe girl is another victim of these experiments. And this time, I want to save her.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I don’t think that’ll be enough to get Minamisawa Senri to forgive me[...] but I want to do it anyway.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“[...]”[%p]
Kurusu’s voice choked up. She must’ve been remembering what happened to her best friend.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“T-Takuru[...] listen to me.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Senri[...] Senri actually[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Y-You know something about her?!”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Tell me, Kurusu.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“I[...] I’m sorry. I’m just having a hard time thinking straight. Senri died in the earthquake. It’s not your fault. I swear it.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Kurusu[...]”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“So you don’t need to blame yourself. You can just forget it. Okay?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
Kurusu looked down at her feet.[%p]
When she did, her hair covered her eyes, and I couldn’t tell what she was thinking.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Kurusu was about to say something[...] and stopped?)[%p]
Just as I was about to ask, I heard soft footsteps.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](They’re here?!)[%p]
Momose’s van was in the same alley where she’d picked us up before. They’d been watching the hospital for a while now.[%p]
I saw two shadows that probably belonged to Shinjo and Kunosato leave the van and run onto the grounds.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Kurusu, they’re on the move. Can you do this?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Huh? Y-Yeah.”[%p]
I tapped her on the shoulder and she looked up.[%p]
That’s why they called her the Empress of Hekiho Academy.[%p]
There was no trace of the sadness that had been there a moment ago.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Sorry. I was just remembering Senri. But I’m okay now.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Honestly, I’d rather you wait here[...]”[%p]
But I couldn’t real boot on my own. I needed a partner, no matter what.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“What are you talking about? I’m not sitting out here and worrying about you.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I thought you’d say that.”[%p]
We followed Shinjo and Kunosato from a distance.[%p]
A moment later, they had pressed themselves up against the wall near the rear emergency entrance.[%p]
Even from a distance, I could tell it was more heavily secured than before.[%p]
The lock seemed to be a newer and sturdier model.[%p]
But Shinjo must’ve already had the key, because he took something out of his pocket and started to put it in the lock.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](They’re planning on getting in from there, huh?)[%p]
All right, then![%p]
I quickly created an image in my mind.[%p]
I looked at the key-like object he was holding,[%p]
and envisioned it flying away.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Damn it. I should’ve trained more[...])[%p]
The more I started to panic, the more I lost focus.[%p]
I couldn’t make the delusion clear in my mind.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Damn it[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Calm down. You’re fine. Calm down.)[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](O-Okay! Got it!)[%p]
I could see the Di-Sword floating in front of me.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Kurusu, I’m going to use your brain for a little bit.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“G-Go ahead[...] though, I guess that’s a weird thing to say.”[%p]
I imagined the delusion I’d come up with going inside Kurusu, Shinjo, and Kunosato’s minds.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Aah[...]”[%p]
Kurusu gasped a little. She must’ve felt something.[%p]
The delusion was shared between us, and instantly, the real boot was complete.[%p]
Clang![%p]
The metallic object in Shinjo’s hand rolled away and hit the ground with a clang.[%p]
Then I heard the two of them gasp.[%p]
The key rolled along the ground in a very unnatural way, until it rolled down a metal sewer grate.[%p]
Just like I’d imagined.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Yes!)[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“You idiot. Hide, Takuru.”[%p]
Just as I was about to make a victory pose, Kurusu grabbed my hand and pulled me back.[%p]
Then she dragged me down onto the ground.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“S-Sorry.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Don’t get cocky. This is why you need me with you.”[%p]
Her hand was shaking a little.[%p]
She was probably still scared of my power, no matter how many times she saw it.[%p]
That was how most people would react.[%p]
I hesitated a moment, then gripped her hand in return. Then I let it go and looked over at Shinjo and Kunosato.[%p]
The two of them whispered to each other, and then silently headed back toward the van.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Now.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
We kept low as we headed for the emergency entrance.[%p]
When we reached the door, I turned around toward Kurusu.[%p]
She caught up a moment later, but her breathing was a little heavy.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“S-Sorry. I went a little fast.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“No, I’m sorry. I wish I was more athletic[...] Can you open the door?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I think so. Kurusu, I’m going to do it once more[...] no, probably a few times. Sorry.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“I don’t care. That’s why I’m here.”[%p]
I stared at the door.[%p]
The lock was stronger than before, probably because of the time we’d broken in.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
I imagined the lock flipping and the door opening.[%p]
There was a heavy click, and the door opened like I’d imagined.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Hahh[...] hahh[...] hahh[...]”[%p]
Thanks to my power, we were able to make it inside with no trouble.[%p]
I remembered the route to the room where we’d found Uki, so we headed there.[%p]
But as we walked through the darkness, I saw that Kurusu was acting a little strange.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Aah[...] hahh[...] hahh[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“A-Are you okay?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Oh, yeah[...] I’m just a little claustrophobic, actually. But I’m fine. Don’t worry about me.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Fine? You’re sweating really bad.”[%p]
And then I realized something.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Is her injury bothering her?)[%p]
She’d seemed like she was okay, but it had been a really bad injury. It couldn’t have fully healed up by now[...][%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“H-Hey, Kurusu—”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“I’m fine. Let’s hurry, okay?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Y-Yeah[...]”[%p]
She pushed me onward before I could stop.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“We’re almost there. It’s not that much farther to the room, so hang in there.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
That’s right. It was right around this corner—[%p]
[name]Young Girl[line]“Waah[...] waaah[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro and others[line]“?!”[linebreak][parallel]“?!”[%p]
Suddenly, we heard a voice sobbing in the darkness. Kurusu and I almost leapt into each other’s arms.[%p]
[name]Young Girl[line]“Waah[...] sob[...] sob[...]”[%p]
It was the voice of a little girl.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“T-Takuru, is this[...]?”[%p]
Was it a ghost?[%p]
No, that was dumb.[%p]
Which meant it had to be[...][%p]
Kurusu and I nodded, and stepped toward the direction of the room.[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Waah[...] waah[...]”[%p]
Just like Shinjo had said, the room was completely empty.[%p]
The beds, and the patients that had been confined there, were all gone.[%p]
It was just an empty room.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
And standing in the middle of the empty room[%p]
was a crying Yamazoe Uki.[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Waah[...] aah[...]”[%p]
How long had she been there?[%p]
She was crying like a child who’d lost their mother.[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Nobody’s here[...] nobody’s here[...]”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Someone[...] answer me[...]”[%p]
Kurusu couldn’t bear to watch. She ran over and gave the girl a big hug.[%p]
Soon, Kurusu was crying, too.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“You really[...] hung in there, huh? But it’s okay now. So let’s go home, okay?”[%p]
But Uki must not have heard her, because she just stood there, crying silently, for a long, long time.[%p]
The whole time— there was nothing I could do but watch.[%p]
