[name]Yui[line]“Really?! Really, really?!”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Yup. Just leave it to me.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Yay! Isn’t that great, Uki? You can stay here, he says!”[%p]
After we got back, Kurusu and I were met with some good news.[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Y-Yes. Thank you very much, sir.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Aw, I told you, you don’t need to be so polite.”[%p]
Shinjo had come here in the afternoon, and that’s what he’d worked out.[%p]
There were several reasons.[%p]
First, Freesia couldn’t keep her any more, but due to her power, it would be difficult to give her to a normal orphanage.[%p]
Second, Shinjo was taking a different route than the other officers on this case, so he said he couldn’t give her to a police facility.[%p]
And the most important thing of all was that this was what Uki wanted. Having her old friend Yui here seemed to be helping her a lot.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“That’s great, Uki.”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Yes[...]”[%p]
She blushed a little and nodded.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Thanks, Dad.”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Don’t worry, I’m actually glad to have her. Unlike a certain someone, she’s very nice, and does a good job with the chores.”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Once she’s feeling a little better, she says she’s going to help around the clinic, too.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Um, Dad, can I assume that last one was directed at me?”[%p]
Yui pouted, but Dad just laughed and ran his hands through her hair.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Where should we put her? We don’t have any spare rooms right now.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“You want to sleep with me, right? Right?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“We can’t do that. What about Yuto?”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Who cares? You don’t mind, do you, Yuu?”[%p]
[name]Yuto[line]“Umm[...]”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“See? He does mind. So no.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Then what about my room?”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“No way! Brother Takuru, you’re such a pervert.”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“There’s no way that’s a good idea.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“N-No, that’s not what I meant.”[%p]
Once this case was settled, I intended to leave.[%p]
So I could sleep in the dining room or something, and she could have my room.[%p]
But Kurusu seemed to know exactly what I was thinking, and she poked me in the stomach.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Wh-What?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“I’m not letting you just leave us again.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“The deal was that I’d only stay here until the case was resolved, right?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“That’s true, but I’ve told you a bunch of times that I don’t think you’ve got any business living on your own.”[%p]
Dad suddenly slapped his hands together.[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Oh, I know. We do have a spare room.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“You know, we had that room that we used to use when the nurses did overnight shifts.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Huh? We use that as a storage room now, though.”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“But that room gets a lot of sun, and I’ve been thinking that it’s a waste to use it as a closet.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Then you should’ve cleaned it out earlier.”[%p]
Kurusu sighed and turned to me.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“We can clean it out tomorrow. Help me with it, okay?”[%p]
[name]Yuto[line]“Okay!”[%p]
Yuto answered cheerfully.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“But what do we do for tonight? Yui can stay with Uki, and Yuto can stay with Dad? Does that work?”[%p]
[name]Yuto[line]“Y-Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Okay! I’ll go get a futon ready! Yuu, can you help me?”[%p]
[name]Yuto[line]“Okay.”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Oh, I can do it myself, ma’am.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“It’s fine. You don’t know where anything is yet, right? And stop being so polite.”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Y-Yes, ma’am.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“And stop saying ‘ma’am.' Just talk normally. Try it, okay?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“O-Okay. But I’m going to help, too.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Yeah? Then let’s both—”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Oh, wait a second.”[%p]
I stopped Uki before Yui could take her out of the room.[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“What’s wrong, Brother Takuru?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Yamazoe? I talked to Shinjo, but I wanted to ask you one more time.”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“I’m sorry?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“You really don’t know where my smartphone is, do you?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Smartphone? Um[...]”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“You know, like one of these.”[%p]
Yui took out her phone and showed it to Uki[...][%p]
When she saw it, she finally seemed to remember.[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Oh, the telephone that Shinjo showed me. I put it back where it fell.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Do you know who picked it up?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“I don’t. I’m sorry[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I[...] I see.”[%p]
So it was just as Shinjo had said, after all.[%p]
Then who had my phone, and the picture inside it?[%p]
And how had they been able to call Itou’s phone?[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Brother Takuru, can we go now? Are you done talking?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Y-Yeah[...]”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Let’s get ready for bed, then. Dad, I can use the stuff from the clinic, right?”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Yeah. We just hung them up to dry and there should be one we haven’t used yet. Also there’s the sheets[...]”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“I know that. Oh, right. Uki, do you want to take a bath together?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Huh? Y-Yes, ma’am.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“I told you to stop that.”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Oh[...] okay.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Yuu, you’re not allowed to take one with us, okay?”[%p]
[name]Yuto[line]“I[...] I know that.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Yui’s really excited.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Yeah. But I can understand. It’s nice having friends.”[%p]
Yui took Uki and Yuto out of the room.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Are you okay, Kurusu?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Why?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“You know, food expenses and stuff. We’ve got another person to take care of now.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“We’ll be fine. Uki says she’s going to help around the house, so it’ll actually get easier. As for food expenses, as long as Dad works hard[...]”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Y-Yeah, leave it to me. Oh, I’m gonna hit the bathroom.”[%p]
Dad quickly ran out of the room to escape Kurusu’s gaze.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“That man[...]”[%p]
She chuckled, but there was a kindness in her laugh.[%p]
