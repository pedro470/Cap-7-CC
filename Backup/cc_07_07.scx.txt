At lunchtime—[%p]
Itou and I were heading to the club room.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Then that Yamazoe Uki girl’s at the Aoba Dorm now?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Yeah. I don’t know what’s going to happen now. But I want to try and help her.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Hmm[...] I still can’t believe she was in Yui’s class, though.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Yeah, I’m surprised, too.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“That’s a good thing though, right?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“A good thing?”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Yui was happy, wasn’t she?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Oh, so that’s what you meant. Yeah.”[%p]
Yui had really looked happy this morning.[%p]
Normally, she probably tried her hardest to play the role of being Yuto’s big sister.[%p]
But she was still only in middle school. If she ran into a friend, of course it would make her happy.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Heheh[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Mmm? Is something funny?”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Nah, just[...] no matter what you say, you really care about your family now, don’t you?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Th-That’s not it.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Don’t blush. It’s a good thing for you, too, isn’t it? To have something like that.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I[...] I’m not blushing! And wait, it doesn’t matter anyway! Come on, let’s go to the club room.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“We need to tell Onoe, Arimura, and Kazuki about Yamazoe, too.”[%p]
Of course, I’d already told everyone to come for an emergency meeting.[%p]
They should be in the room already.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“—so now Yamazoe Uki is safe at Aoba Dorm.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Taku, way to go!”[%p]
[name]Kazuki[line]“Mmm!”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Nah, it was nothing[...]”[%p]
The girls all seemed very impressed.[%p]
Serika was squeezing her Gero Froggy strap in lieu of applause.[%p]
It still sounded nothing like it was supposed to, and honestly, I would’ve preferred the applause[...] but I was used to it now, I guess.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Serika, Kazuki, don’t flatter him too much. He’ll do something crazy again.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I will not.”[%p]
Sheesh. I appreciated that she was worried about me, but Kurusu was a little too protective.[%p]
I especially wished she’d stop it when everyone else was around. It was embarrassing.[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“It feels good, though. I bet Shinjo and Kunosato are so pissed off right now. Serves that bitch right. Heheh.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Did you know about Yamazoe, Arimura?”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Yeah, I just talked to her a little on the phone.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“She didn’t say much of anything at Freesia, I guess. She was probably scared of them.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Yeah, I’m sure.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“But I guess she was pretty talkative in front of you, huh? Maybe you just look dumb, and you actually know how to treat a lady?”[%p]
Arimura grinned.[%p]
Of course I do! I’ve read every issue of Cool Cat Press that I could find![%p]
—I couldn't say that, though, so I didn't.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“N-No. It’s because Kurusu and Yui were there.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Of course. You didn’t take me seriously, did you? That’s creepy.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Grr[...]”[%p]
I was never going to get used to this. For one thing, no matter how hard I tried to glare at her, she just smirked.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]?”[%p]
I was trying to think of a good comeback when the door to the club room suddenly opened.[%p]
The door opened softly, but it was clear that the person standing in front of it was furious.[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“You[...]”[%p]
Speak of the Devil[...] Kunosato was there, and the light in her eyes was as cold and fierce as ever.[%p]
Instead of yelling, her voice was low and threatening.[%p]
I figured that she’d eventually find out that we were the ones who’d taken Uki[...] but I didn’t expect her here so soon.[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“What are you thinking?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Wh-What?”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“She’s important evidence. Don’t start messing with her.”[%p]
Kunosato stomped over to me and grabbed me by the lapel.[%p]
Her arms were so thin, I didn’t know where she got the strength. It was like she was filled with some kind of raw hatred that gave her power.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Ugh[...]”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Hey, stop!”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Violence is wrong!”[%p]
Serika and Kurusu grabbed her and tried to pull her off. But she held on to me tightly.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I[...] I didn’t force her to leave.”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“She wanted to come with us. She said she didn’t want to go with you.”[%p]
That was only a half-truth.[%p]
But I felt like I had to say it anyway.[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“And what do you mean, ‘evidence'? She’s not a thing, or a test subject. So I can’t let you have her.”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“You don’t know anything, you asshole.”[%p]
Her hand gripped me tighter.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Gaah[...]”[%p]
What the hell was going on?[%p]
What was wrong with this woman?![%p]
I felt a powerful rage building up within me.[%p]
There was a low buzzing in my ears, and Kurusu and Serika’s shouts suddenly seemed to be very far away.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](God damn it!)[%p]
And then I saw the Di-Sword.[%p]
—And it was clearer than it had ever been before.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Let me go, damn it!”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“?!”[%p]
Her face suddenly twisted in pain.[%p]
I looked at her with blurry eyes, and saw that a red mark had formed on her pale white wrist, as if something was digging into it.[%p]
She was gritting her teeth, and her breathing made it seem like she was trying to endure some kind of incredible pain. But still she refused to let go.[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Miyashiro! No! Don’t do it!”[%p]
Arimura’s scream seemed like it was coming from underwater.[%p]
The new, violent temptations within me had almost taken control.[%p]
What she’s trying to do is wrong! I’ll get rid of her myself![%p]
That righteous anger, combined with—[%p]
With this power, I can do anything I want![%p]
—a maddeningly sweet feeling of omnipotence, overflowed from within me and refused to stop.[%p]
“That’s right! Do it! Just kill the bitch!” it screamed.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Stop it right now, Takuru!”[%p]
I heard Kurusu yell in my ear. At the same time, I felt a strong slap across the cheek.[%p]
And then Kunosato and I were pulled apart.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]!”[%p]
I suddenly regained control of my senses.[%p]
Kurusu, Itou, and Serika had grabbed me and were holding me back, while Arimura and Kazuki were doing the same to Kunosato.[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“Grr[...]!”[%p]
Kunosato looked at me with eyes full of hate, and then pushed Arimura and Kazuki away.[%p]
[name]Arimura and others[line]“Ah!”[linebreak][parallel]“—!”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Watch out!”[%p]
Serika quickly grabbed them and held them up.[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“A-Are you okay?”[%p]
[name]Kazuki[line]“Mmm[...]”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Thanks, Seri.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Enough of this, Kunosato.”[%p]
Now it was the Empress’s turn to get mad.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Please leave. You’re not part of this club, and you’re not welcome here.”[%p]
She was clutching her hands into fists so tightly that they’d turned white, standing between Kunosato and the rest of us as if she was some kind of protector.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“I don’t know why you’re behaving this way toward Takuru, Uki, and Arimura. But I won’t allow it.”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“I don’t need your permission. You saw it just now. Psychics are dangerous—”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Leave. Now.”[%p]
Kurusu’s voice left no room for discussion.[%p]
Neither of them moved a muscle for a moment.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Oh, wait. Stop! Stop!”[%p]
And then we heard panting coming from the hallway.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]?”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Hahh[...] hahh[...] hahh[...] I figured you’d be here, Kunosato.”[%p]
It was Shinjo.[%p]
He must’ve been running for a while, because his hair was messed up, and there was sweat on his forehead.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Didn’t I ask you to leave this to me?”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“The way you want to do it takes so long that the evidence we need will be destroyed.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“I know you’re in a hurry, but there are better ways to do things[...] I’m sorry, Kurusu. We didn’t come here to fight.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Then why are you here?”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Please don’t look at me like that[...]”[%p]
Shinjo looked at both of them, troubled.[%p]
And then he turned toward me.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Listen, Miyashiro. I know what you’re going to say. And I don’t blame you for taking Uki last night. We were probably in the wrong there.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“So now we’ve come to ask you a favor. We want Uki, and if possible you and Arimura, to get an examination at a proper facility.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“What?!”[%p]
Arimura responded before I could.[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“If anyone needs their head examined, it’s you! Did you honestly think we’d say, ‘Yes, please run a bunch of experiments on me!'?”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Let me finish. This is for your sake, really.”[%p]
His next words came as a shock to me.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“We actually just spoke to Dr. Sakuma.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro and others[line]“To Dad?!”[linebreak][parallel]“To Dad?!”[%p]
Both Kurusu and I shouted at the same time.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“You two don’t[...] You don’t like the way Kunosato does things, right? Then why not go to a hospital run by a friend of Dr. Sakuma’s?”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“Hey, you can’t just—”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Kunosato.”[%p]
Shinjo put up a hand to cut her off.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“You know that this is the only way they’re ever going to agree, right? I’ll let you come, too.”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“Tch[...]”[%p]
Kunosato furrowed her brow in anger, then turned around and left the room.[%p]
Shinjo waited until he couldn’t hear her footsteps anymore, and then sighed a little in relief. Then he continued.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“So how about it, you two? I heard that Dr. Sakuma was once an assistant professor at a university medical department, after all.”[%p]
I didn’t know that.[%p]
Kurusu must not have known it, either, because she looked over at me, confused.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Dad was an assistant professor?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I didn’t know that.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“I thought he was just a weird old man.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Hey[...] I mean, the way he looks, I can see where you’d get that idea, but[...]”[%p]
Shinjo laughed, seemingly in sympathy with my dad.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“I think a friend of his can be trusted. What about you?”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Either way, I refuse.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“I thought so.”[%p]
Shinjo chuckled. He was probably anticipating that response.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“But you know, Arimura, from what Dr. Sakuma said, your powers might be having a bad effect on your health.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Go meet Yamazoe Uki. You’ll find it very difficult to believe that she’s 14 years old. Right, Miyashiro?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
It was true that Uki looked the same as she did in her old school pictures. It was like the passage of time had stopped for her.[%p]
If that was caused by her powers[...][%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Dr. Sakuma’s opinion is that she needs a detailed examination, no matter what.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Why not have them take a look at the two of you while they’re at it? Just think of it as a checkup. How does that sound?”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“[...]”[%p]
Arimura was still unsure, it seemed[...] but what happened to Uki must’ve bothered her.[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Let me think about it for a little.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Yeah, that’s fine.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“I haven’t said I would yet, okay?”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Of course.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“U-Um[...]”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Mmm?”[%p]
—I looked out the door where Kunosato had just left.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“If Dad says I need an exam, I’ll get one. But if Kunosato starts[...] treating Yamazoe or Arimura like guinea pigs in the middle of it[...]”[%p]
I hesitated for a second, unsure of what to say. But then I continued.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I[...] I’ll get mad. I’ll use my powers and[...] wreck everything so that you can’t do an exam. Please remember that.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“T-Taku!”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Dude!”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“You can’t do that! What are you saying?”[%p]
Everyone was shocked at seeing me act so differently than usual.[%p]
But I remembered the sense of power, of omnipotence, that I’d just felt[...] and shivered a little.[%p]
That’s right. I could do it. I would do it.[%p]
If I had to, I could do what I just did—[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Understood. I’ll make sure she understands that during the exam. Will that do?”[%p]
Shinjo sighed a little and shook his head.[%p]
He was probably trying to come up with a way to keep Kunosato quiet and not having much luck.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“All right. Sorry to interrupt your club time.”[%p]
He went to leave the room, but just before he stepped into the hallway, he turned around.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Oh, oops. I had something else important to say, and I almost forgot it because of Kunosato.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“What is it?”[%p]
It was clear from Kurusu’s voice that she was still upset.[%p]
Shinjo may have been used to dealing with Kunosato, but the Empress was a whole different animal altogether. He flinched a little.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Um, this is for Miyashiro, Onoe, and Itou.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“M-Me?”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“I didn’t do anything.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Neither did I!”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“You three trespassed into the hospital basement, didn’t you?”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Gah! Th-That was[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Wait, didn’t you and Kunosato do the same thing?”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Haha, that’s right. So that was just a joke.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Well, it wasn’t funny.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“You really scared me.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Actually, I wanted to ask you something about that.”[%p]
Shinjo’s voice dropped several decibels as he continued.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Kunosato said there was data on a girl named Minamisawa Senri on the computer there.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“[...]”[%p]
I heard Kurusu gasp a little.[%p]
Shinjo didn’t know about Kurusu and Minamisawa, though, so he just looked confused for a moment before quickly continuing.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Kunosato says you saw it, too. Do you remember?”[%p]
Suddenly hearing that name almost brought back the trauma, but[...][%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Yeah, I saw it.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“The data was there, right?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Yes.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“I see.”[%p]
Shinjo looked at Itou and Serika, too.[%p]
They both nodded.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Then I want you to see this. It’s evidence, so I couldn’t bring the real thing here, but[...]”[%p]
He put his hand in his pocket and took out a photo.[%p]
It showed what looked like an ID card.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]!”[%p]
I couldn’t believe my eyes.[%p]
The card looked old, and it was dirty and scratched in spots.[%p]
But the name and face on it were clearly visible.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Minamisawa Senri!)[%p]
That’s right. The name Minamisawa Senri was displayed under the ID number.[%p]
The expressionless face in the picture was, without a doubt, the girl I’d seen in the basement.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Well? Could it just be a different person with the same name? Kunosato insists that it’s her.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“It’s her. I’m sure of it.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Yes, I think so, too.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Me too.”[%p]
All three of us answered instantly.[%p]
Shinjo nodded and put the picture back in his pocket.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“I see. Thank you.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Um[...] That girl, Minamisawa Senri[...] is something going on with her?”[%p]
I asked, trying to say it in a way that wouldn’t bother Kurusu.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Last night[...] It would’ve been just about the time you two took Uki to Aoba Dorm, I suppose.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Two officers on patrol near Shinsen Station found a woman they believe to be a suspect in the serial arson case.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro and others[line]“Huh?!”[linebreak][parallel]“Huh?!”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Then that’s the pyrokinetic who attacked us?”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Yeah. Your testimony and the composite sketch that Arimura helped with matched, I’m told. And more than anything, she supposedly was using fire.”[%p]
“Supposedly.” “I’m told.”[%p]
Those words probably meant[...][%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“She escaped, didn’t she?”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“They were attacked when they went to question her. One was badly burned and is in the ICU.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“The other officer tried to grab her and got into a struggle. He was badly burned on the arms and legs, too, but during the struggle, she dropped this.”[%p]
He patted the photo in his pocket.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
That woman had Minamisawa Senri’s ID card?[%p]
Why?[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Does that mean she’s the one who attacked Miyashiro?”[%p]
Suddenly there was a loud crash.[%p]
I turned and saw that Kurusu had gone deathly pale, and been forced to grab a table to stop from falling over.[%p]
Her teacup was lying shattered on the table. The sound was probably from when she’d dropped it.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Kurusu!”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Kurusu?!”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Are you okay?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Y-Yes[...] I’m sorry. I just felt a little dizzy.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Sit down, Vice President.”[%p]
[name]Kazuki[line]“Mmm.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Th-Thanks.”[%p]
Kazuki dragged a chair over for her to sit in, and she collapsed down on top of it.[%p]
Shinjo seemed to realize that something was wrong.[%p]
He hesitated a moment, and then asked in as soft a tone as he could muster,[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Kurusu? Do you know something about Minamisawa Senri?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Um, Shinjo, that’s not—”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“I’m fine, Takuru.”[%p]
Kurusu looked up and cut me off.[%p]
And then she told him how Minamisawa Senri was her childhood friend, and that she was being used as a test subject in the experiments conducted in that basement.[%p]
And finally[...][%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“But her name’s on the memorial for the victims of the Shibuya earthquake. It can’t be her.”[%p]
That’s how she finished.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Th-That’s right. Kunosato said she probably died in the earthquake, too.”[%p]
I quickly added.[%p]
Shinjo thought for a moment, and then spoke, even more gently than before.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Kurusu, thank you for telling me this.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“The police are investigating whether the records of her death are accurate. Depending on what we find, I’m afraid I may have to ask you to come down to the station to talk to them.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“That’s fine, though I do believe it’s some kind of mistake.”[%p]
There was no doubt in her voice.[%p]
Shinjo chuckled a little.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“I don’t want to doubt your friend, but it’s part of my job[...]”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Whoever the arsonist might be, there’s a chance they might come after you two again, Miyashiro, Arimura. Be careful.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Ugh[...] You’re right, aren’t you?”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“She knows you’re psychics now. If something happens, call me any time, 24 hours a day.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Also, don’t tell anyone about Minamisawa Senri until the police make an official announcement. I don’t want the media finding out until we know the truth of the matter. Thanks.”[%p]
Shinjo took one last worried look at Kurusu, and then left the room.[%p]
Everyone fell silent, lost in their own thoughts.[%p]
In the end, we canceled the club meeting, and Kurusu went to the student council to finish up her work. She was still pale.[%p]
We all got ready to go, but for some reason, no one actually left. Serika and Arimura were paging through magazines.[%p]
Kazuki was still silently playing ESO2.[%p]
Itou and I were thinking about the case, and glancing occasionally at the map on the wall.[%p]
There was a new sticky memo on the map.[%p]
While I was trying to decide if we should add it, Kurusu had written it down and copied it herself.[%18]
Her normally beautiful handwriting was a little unsteady.[%p]
She’d probably been shaking as she wrote it.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Minamisawa Senri, huh?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Yeah[...]”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“The girl in the ID card photo does look a lot like the one Arimura described for that sketch.”[%p]
Arimura looked up from her magazine.[%p]
She was staring at me.[%p]
She didn’t say it aloud, but it was obvious that she was trying to tell me that she thought so, too.[%p]
I thought back to when we’d been attacked by the pyrokinetic.[%p]
She was a lot older, but if the girl on that ID card grew up, she might look like that, yeah.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Then was she the one who attacked us? But that can’t be.)[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“If only we had some more solid information[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Maybe that girl knows something.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“That girl?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Yeah[...]”[%p]
I hesitated for a moment, but then realized that we weren’t getting anywhere as things stood. So I held out my hand toward Itou.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Let me borrow your phone for a second.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“You still don’t have a new one?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I’ll get one soon. Thanks.”[%p]
I took the phone from Itou and dialed the number.[%p]
After a few rings, I heard a voice I knew well.[%p]
It was a gruff voice that I’d heard almost every day lately.[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Hello, this is Aoba Clinic.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Hello, Dad? It’s me.”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Mmm? Oh, Takuru? What is it?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“It’s about Yamazoe. What is she doing right now?”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Oh, I’m giving her an IV in the exam room. She looked a little malnourished. Like you said, she was probably in a really bad environment.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Can I talk to her on the phone?”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“She’s not asleep, so that should be okay. Just give me a second.”[%p]
I could hear him get farther away from the phone.[%p]
A second later, I heard a loud, high-pitched girl’s voice.[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Hey, Brother Takuru! Uki’s getting treatment right now. You can’t bother her.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Your yelling is probably bothering her worse than I would, right?”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Huh?”[%p]
Yui had probably been so worried about Yamazoe that she’d raced home after school. It was great to see her being such a good friend, but right now it was a huge nuisance.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Just let me talk to Yamazoe. It’s important.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“It can’t wait?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Um[...] this is a secret, okay? I don’t want Kurusu to find out. So don’t you tell anybody, okay?”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“[...]”[%p]
There was silence on the line for a moment as she thought.[%p]
But eventually, she reluctantly agreed.[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Okay. Just hold on a second.”[%p]
Since it was just me, she probably didn’t feel the need to hit the hold button. I could hear doors opening and closing as she went to the exam room.[%p]
There was some whispering, and then I heard another girl’s voice.[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“U-Um[...] Hello?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Hey, sorry to bother you. You’re not feeling well?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“I’m fine. I said I was okay, but Dr. Sakuma and Yui were worried about me.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I see.”[%p]
I was relieved to hear that she wasn’t in bad shape. What I was about to ask might be bad for her, mentally.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Hey, do you know a girl named Minamisawa Senri?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“I’m sorry?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Minamisawa Senri. According to the records, she went to the same facility you did until the Shibuya earthquake. She would’ve been[...] um, that was six years ago, so maybe around 12?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Minamisawa Senri[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“That’s right. Is there anything you remember about her, no matter how small?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Minamisawa[...] Minamisawa[...]”[%p]
She seemed to be trying her best to remember.[%p]
I saw that the rest of the newspaper club, not just Itou, but Serika, Arimura, and Kazuki as well, were staring at me and trying to hear the conversation.[%p]
Yamazoe thought a little more before she spoke.[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Um[...] I never met or talked with her directly. But[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“But?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“I saw her going into the treatment room several times. They said her treatment was more painful than mine. So the doctors told me I had to work hard, too.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
I remembered the experiments I’d seen as a little kid, and the tiny girl crying for help, and I shivered.[%p]
But Uki had it far worse than I did. She’d actually been exposed to the same torture that Minamisawa Senri was.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I[...] I’m sorry to make you remember something so horrible.”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“No, I never thought it was horrible.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I see.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Is there anything else you remember?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Oh, right[...] Minamisawa had hurt her leg, I think.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Her leg?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Yes[...] when I saw her, she was always dragging one leg. The doctors would always help her into the treatment room.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Dragging one leg[...]”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“So I was sure she was getting treatment for her leg.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
Dragging her leg?[%p]
Wasn’t that[...][%p]
The same thing the pyrokinetic was doing?[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“U-Um[...] Miyashiro?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“No, sorry. If I need anything else, I’ll ask. Thanks.”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“All right. I’ll give the phone back to Yui—”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Just hang up. She’s being annoying. Anyway, see you later.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Hey, I heard that! What do you mean, annoying—”[%p]
I hung up the phone before she could finish, and handed it back to Itou. Then I looked at the map again.[%p]
I saw the two notes that Kurusu had written in a trembling hand.[%p]
“Pyrokinetic found. The woman had Senri’s ID card.”[%p]
“Pyrokinetic/Killer might be Senri.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Is that woman really Minamisawa Senri?”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“But she’s dead, right? Her name’s on the memorial like the vice president said.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Yeah. But the data we saw underground said she was missing.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“And that’s—”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Yeah. Just like Shinjo had said, I was sure that meant she was dead. Kurusu had said so, too.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“But what if the data was right, and she’d only gone missing?”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“What do you mean?”[%p]
Serika was looking between me and the map in confusion.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Don’t you remember, Onoe? AH Tokyo General was one of the main relief centers during the earthquake. They would’ve had any number of ways to share data.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“But that’s kind of strange. If her name’s on the memorial, that means that some hospital somewhere, or maybe the police, officially declared her dead.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Right? That was a pretty large-scale operation. They wouldn’t miss it if one of their test subjects was dead.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“They wouldn’t write ‘missing,' yeah.”[%p]
Itou crossed his arms and thought.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Which means her name on the memorial’s a mistake[...] or a deliberate lie?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“That’s probably what Shinjo suspects. That Minamisawa Senri is alive, and that she’s after us.”[%p]
The red sun was about to sink below the buildings on the horizon.[%p]
I looked out the window and saw that the sunlight had illuminated the clouds and formed a brilliant twilight. But soon it would disappear, and the cold night would come.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“But if Minamisawa Senri’s the killer, why would she attack you?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I don’t know. Maybe she hates psychics for some reason, and just happened to find me[...]”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“If that’s the case, then what’s the point of recreating the New Generation Madness?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Of course, if there’s some kind of message encoded in the killings, that’s a different matter.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
Some kind of message[...][%p]
Back then—[%p]
When Minamisawa Senri had begged me for help, I’d left her there.[%p]
“I was just a kid. What could I do?”[%p]
No matter how much I told myself that, she probably wouldn’t agree.[%p]
She’d thought I was a ray of hope, and I’d left her there and ran.[%p]
It wouldn’t surprise me if the memories of that turned to hatred and rage that she would never forget.[%p]
And after she was set free during the Shibuya earthquake, she attacked me.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Aah!”[%p]
Suddenly I remembered the time when she’d attacked me.[%p]
The smile on her face had chilled me to the bone.[%p]
And this is what she’d said—[%p]
[name]Woman[line]“I found you[...]”[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Could it be revenge?)[%p]
Was this whole thing Minamisawa Senri’s way of getting revenge on me?![%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Damn it, that’s impossible!”[%p]
I realized what I was thinking, and slapped my hands against my cheeks to drive the thought from my mind.[%p]
