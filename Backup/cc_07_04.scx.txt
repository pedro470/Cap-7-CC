[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Haha, what's wrong, Takuru? You look so glum.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I was born looking this way.”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Come on, can't you say something more fun?”[%p]
Dad was as jovial as ever.[%p]
Without his lab coat, no one would ever believe he was a doctor.[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Well? Hmm? I bet it feels good to be back home again, right?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“No, not really.”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Well, you’ve just started living on your own, so maybe you don’t realize it yet. But eventually, you’ll come to know that home is where the heart is! Hahaha!”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
In the end, I’d come back here to Aoba Dorm[...][%p]
Because Kurusu had told me to do so at school.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Someone might be after you, right? It's dangerous to be alone.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“It doesn't have to be forever. It can just be for a little while. Live at home until this is resolved.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
I wasn’t her slave or anything, but just like she said, it was dangerous to be alone right now.[%p]
Especially when we didn’t know who the killer was, or what they were after[...] If someone was nearby, it would be easier to get a hold of Shinjo and his allies if I needed to.[%p]
And[...] I was probably never going to be able to tell this to Kurusu[...] but the feelings I’d felt when I’d left home were starting to disappear.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
After seeing Kurusu get hurt, or try to protect me,[%p]
or cry for my sake despite being such a strong girl[...][%p]
I’d started to understand some things that I hadn’t known when I’d left.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](What the hell, damn it!)[%p]
I realized what I was thinking and shook my head.[%p]
No way.[%p]
I wasn’t like Yuto, who could never seem to get away from his sister.[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Hey, why are you turning red?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“N-Nothing.”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Anyway, go put your stuff away. Nono’s kept your room clean.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Oh[...]”[%p]
Dad didn’t get mad when I’d left, or when I’d come back.[%p]
Come to think of it, he’d only said one thing on the day I’d left.[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Once you understand why Nono felt she had to do what she did, come back. Bye.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I’ll go put my stuff away.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Hey, Dad, is it true that Brother Takuru’s coming back?”[%p]
As I went toward my room, Yui appeared.[%p]
I could see Yuto behind her.[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Yup. He’s back already.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Oh[...]”[%p]
Yui’s face almost broke into a broad smile when she saw me, but quickly forced herself to assume a strict expression.[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“What are you doing?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“You have to clean the bath and the kitchen and the hallway! Yuu and I have been doing all your work for you while you were gone!”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“O-Oh, sorry.”[%p]
I apologized without thinking.[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“So you’re going to do our jobs for a while now, okay? Got it?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Y-Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Yuto[line]“B-Big Brother Takuru, it’s fine. It doesn’t bother me[...]”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“No. You need to be strict about this. ‘Formality, even between friends,’ is a Japanese saying, right?”[%p]
[name]Yuto[line]“But if you tell him that[...] he’ll go away again. And after he just came back, too.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“I said he has to, and that’s that.”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Hahaha[...] hey, Takuru, don’t you think Yui’s starting to turn into Nono?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Y-Yeah. Especially when she’s mad.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Did you say something?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“No, nothing. Sorry.”[%p]
Yui put her hands on her hips, and puffed up her flat chest to glare at me. She did look just like Kurusu when she did that.[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Brother Takuru’s only so selfish because you spoil him, Dad.”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Oh, now she’s mad at me, huh?”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“So, Brother Takuru, you’re not going anywhere again, are you?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh? No.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“You know how sad Big Sis Nono’s been since you left, right?”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“And Yuu’s missed you a lot, too.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I[...] I see.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“And I[...] No, it hasn’t really bothered me.”[%p]
—And suddenly, the expression on her face changed.[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“It hasn’t, but[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“H-Hey[...]”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Sob[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh? Y-Yui?!”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“[...]”[%p]
S-Stop that![%p]
I’m not good with that stuff! I can’t handle it when people cry![%p]
[name]Yui[line]“I-It’s nothing[...] sob[...]”[%p]
Yui covered her face with her hands, and then ran into her room.[%p]
Yuto followed quickly after her.[%p]
Dad scratched his head and sighed a little as he saw them go.[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Come on, go put your things away, Takuru.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“O-Okay.”[%p]
I got away as quickly as I could.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Whew[...]”[%p]
That scared me.[%p]
I didn’t expect Yui to start crying all of a sudden.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
I thought nothing would really change around here, even if I left.[%p]
But[...][%p]
Did they really need me here that much?[%p]
If they did[...][%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](No, but[...])[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh[...]?”[%p]
As I sat there, lost in thought, I was suddenly startled by a knock at the door.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Wh-Who is it?”[%p]
[name]Yuto[line]“Big Brother Takuru[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“O-Oh, hey, Yuto.”[%p]
[name]Yuto[line]“Um[...] Big Sis Nono says to come down when you’ve changed.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Y-Yeah. Thanks.”[%p]
[name]Yuto[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“What is it?”[%p]
[name]Yuto[line]“U-Um[...] about Big Sis Yui[...]”[%p]
Yuto crossed his hands over his stomach and fidgeted as he looked up at me.[%p]
[name]Yuto[line]“She was mad about a lot of stuff[...] but she said she really wanted you to come home[...] so she wasn’t really mad.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“It’s okay. I know.”[%p]
[name]Yuto[line]“Really?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Yeah. So head on down. I’ll get changed and come join you.”[%p]
[name]Yuto[line]“Okay.”[%p]
Yuto looked a little relieved as he left the room.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Yuto’s gotten a little taller, huh?)[%p]
Yuto and Yui had come here at almost the exact same time I had.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](I was worried about how it would go when we first started, but[...])[%p]
The Shibuya earthquake hadn’t just taken their parents from them. It had caused them severe psychological trauma.[%p]
During the earthquake, Yuto had been trapped in a dark place for a long time, all by himself. As a result, he was still terrified of darkness and being alone.[%p]
That was why he still clung to his sister.[%p]
And Yui— after the nightmarish incident she’d gone through after the earthquake, she’d become desperately afraid of men.[%p]
At first, she was even afraid of me.[%p]
But over time, we started to open up to one another[...][%p]
When I’d left, they’d seemed to be doing a lot better.[%p]
And now, Yui had her act together even more.[%p]
And Yuto was still young, but he did seem a little more grown-up than he had before.[%p]
Even if the world didn’t look like it had changed, time was still passing[...][%p]
But what about me?[%p]
Had I changed?[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Okay, it’s ready.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“All right, let’s eat.”[%p]
[name]Yuto[line]“Let’s eat.”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Oho? It feels like forever since we’ve had sukiyaki.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“What are you talking about? We had it last month.”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Listen, that was chicken. You can’t call it sukiyaki unless you make it with beef.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“We don’t have the money to waste on that.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“It’s a certain someone’s fault for saying, ‘We can’t take money to treat people when they’re in trouble.' Well, not that it bothers me.”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“You don’t have to put it like that. Show me some more respect.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Right, right.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Here, Takuru, give me your bowl. I’ll give you some.”[%p]
Kurusu reached out her hand toward me.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh? I[...] I’m fine.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“You are not fine. You haven’t been eating right lately, have you? Just give me the bowl.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Ah[...]”[%p]
Kurusu grabbed the bowl from me, and heaped the beaten egg high with meat and vegetables.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Here. Make sure you eat.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Oh, okay[...]”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Brother Takuru, there’s some meat here. Take it.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I-I’ve got enough, really.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“What? You’ll eat Big Sis Nono’s meat, but not mine?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Are you pretending to be a drunk old man or something?”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Hey, wait, guys. The meat’s all gone!”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“It’s first come, first serve. That’s what you always say.”[%p]
[name]Yuto[line]“You always say it.”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“I just said you should show me some more respect.”[%p]
Everyone was seated around a single pot, eating dinner.[%p]
I thought that the only point of dinner was to eat until you were full, but[...][%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Takuru? Yuto? There’s more meat in the fridge. Have some.”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Hey!”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“You need to lose some weight, Dad. Eat your vegetables.”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“You know, I don’t remember raising you to be like that.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Even if you don’t remember it, you did. So give up.”[%p]
Part of me enjoyed sitting around the table and listening to everyone’s conversation[...][%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Oh!)[%p]
No, that wasn’t true.[%p]
I definitely wasn’t homesick.[%p]
Maybe it was just that having someone near me made me feel better,[%p]
Maybe it was having Kurusu offer to help me when I’d been in trouble on my own.[%p]
But it definitely wasn’t that I was happy to be home, or glad to have come back to where I belonged—[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“[...]ther Takuru?”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Brother Takuru!”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh? What?”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“You want some tea or not? I’ve been asking and you keep ignoring me.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Oh, sorry.”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Haha, you know him. He’s probably thinking about something overly complicated.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“What do you mean, overly complicated? I never over-complicate things[...]”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Right, stop. No one cares. Do you want some tea?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I’d rather have some Mountain View[...]”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“We don’t have any here.”[%p]
[name]Yuto[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Mmm? Yuto? What is it? Why are you smiling?”[%p]
[name]Yuto[line]“It’s just more fun having everyone here. You look really happy, too, Big Sis Nono.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Do I? Heheh[...] Yeah. Maybe I do.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]!”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“—!”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]!”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Hahh[...]”[%p]
It didn't work.[%p]
I’d gotten a lot better at seeing my Di-Sword,[%p]
but I still didn’t know how to grab hold of it.[%p]
I asked Arimura for help, but her answers weren’t really helpful.[%p]
Unlike with my psychokinesis, all I needed to do was draw my Di-Sword from the Dirac sea. I should be able to do it alone.[%p]
But when I was by myself, it was just an illusion[...] Unless I real booted it, I wouldn’t be able to use it to attack or defend.[%p]
If I wanted to use it as a weapon, I needed to share the delusion with someone else, just like with my other power. At least, that’s what Arimura had said[...][%p]
But before that, I needed to be able to grab hold of it.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Damn it. One more time[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“—!”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Reach out your arm[...] fix the image of the sword in your mind[...] God damn it!)[%p]
Whenever I tried to get close to the Di-Sword, it moved away from me like a mirage.[%p]
If I just flailed my arm at it, I couldn’t reach it.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“M-My hand’s starting to go numb[...]”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Takuru? I’m coming in.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Oh, wait!”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
I had my hand stretched out, like a TV hero in the middle of his transformation.[%p]
And Kurusu was staring at me, her eyes wide.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“N-No! It’s not what it looks like! I’m teaching Yuto a new transformation pose!”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Yuto says he’s too old for that stuff now.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh? He does?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“[...]”[%p]
Kurusu put her hand on her cheek and sighed.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“If you’re planning on becoming a real hero on your own[...] give it up, okay?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I am not. How old do you think I am?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“No matter how old you get, you always act like a kid.”[%p]
And then she stared into my eyes.[%p]
I could tell that she wasn’t blaming me, and that she was genuinely concerned.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Takuru, sit down over there, okay?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“No, I’m just about to take a bath[...]”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Just sit down, all right?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Oh[...] okay.”[%p]
I sat down on the bed, as I was told.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Takuru?”[%p]
Kurusu took a step toward the bed and looked down over me.[%p]
Humans are strange creatures. Whenever someone looks down on us, they seem bigger and more powerful.[%p]
I quickly stood up and looked down over her instead.[%p]
When I first met her, she was almost at eye level with me, but now[...][%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I’m not training to try and do something bad.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Someone’s after you because of your powers. If you keep trying to use them like that—”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“It’s the other way around. If I can learn to master them, I can protect myself, and I can protect everyone in the newspaper club or here at Aoba Dorm.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“But that’s the police’s job, right?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I don’t think the police are going to be able to save us if we need it.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“But—”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“What about you, Kurusu? You always say you’re going to protect us, but what are you going to do if a psychic attacks?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“I’ll[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“See? So I’ve got no choice but to learn how to use my powers.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“[...]”[%p]
Kurusu stared down at her feet, silently.[%p]
Then she raised her head and looked me in the eye.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Listen, Takuru, I’ve known you for a long time. So I can tell what you’re going to start thinking.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“What I’m going to start thinking?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“You’re going to put yourself in danger. You’ll try and use your power to catch the killer, maybe.”[%p]
I gulped.[%p]
I hadn’t really thought about it yet, but knowing me, I’d probably[...] no, definitely[...] think that.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Wh-What? You’re not a psychic, so how do you know the future[...]”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“I always know you, right? Even without any psychic powers, I can tell exactly what you’re going to do.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Anyway, please. Just focus on protecting yourself. Okay, Takuru?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“U-Um[...]”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Please[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]O-Okay.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Okay, then pinky swear.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
Pinky swear? Are we supposed to be little kids?[%p]
No way. That’s embarrassing.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“If you lie, you’re going to get a lot worse than being forced to swallow a thousand needles.”[%p]
And that’s really scary![%p]
Then the heavens intervened to save me, and a phone rang out like the [color index="280AA02D1400"]Gjallarhorn[color index="800000"].[%p]
I hadn’t gotten a new one yet, so of course, it was Kurusu’s.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Y-You’re not going to answer it?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“I’m talking to you right now.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“But it might have something to do with the case[...]”[%p]
She must’ve thought I might be right, because she took out the phone and looked at the screen.[%p]
And then she looked concerned.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“It’s Shinjo.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
I’d only said it to distract her, but evidently the call really did have something to do with the case.[%p]
She quickly hit the answer button and put the phone up to her ear.[%p]
I watched her, nervously.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Hello, this is Kurusu. Yes. Yes[...] Yeah[...]”[%p]
On the other side of the phone,[%p]
I could hear a note of concern in Shinjo’s voice.[%p]
I couldn't tell for sure, but he seemed to be saying that someone had gone missing.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“No, she hasn’t. She shouldn’t even know where this place is to begin with. Huh? Takuru?”[%p]
Wh-What?[%p]
What did I do?[%p]
Kurusu moved the phone away from her ear and turned back toward me.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“You know that Yamazoe girl, right?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh? Yeah, the girl we saved from the hospital basement.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“She’s gone missing, he says.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“What?”[%p]
She was missing?[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“He wanted to know if you’d taken her.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Of course not! I’ve been with you the whole day.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“That’s right, yeah.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Give me the phone. I want to talk to Shinjo.”[%p]
I reached my hand toward the phone.[%p]
