[name]Momose[line]“Hahh[...]”[%p]
Trustworthiness Investigation Corporation Freesia.[%p]
Momose Katsuko sat in a reception room in a messy corner of her office and sighed as she ran her hand through her hair.[%p]
[name]Momose[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Please, let me go home.”[%p]
[name]Momose[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Please[...] let me go home.”[%p]
No matter how many questions she asked, or how she tried to get her to talk, that was the only answer she would get.[%p]
Sometimes she'd tried asking if there was anything she wanted, or if she felt like eating anything.[%p]
But the answer was always the same.[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Please. Let me go home.”[%p]
She hadn't made even the tiniest bit of progress since the girl had arrived.[%p]
Even the endlessly patient Momose would want to sigh after all that.[%p]
She still didn't know where this Yamazoe Uki girl was from, or how she'd ended up in that hospital.[%p]
But from what she'd seen, there was a chance she'd endured significant abuse.[%p]
And then she was suddenly rescued from it, and taken to a completely different environment. So she must have been very confused.[%p]
She knew from experience that victims like that needed to be treated very carefully.[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“If I don't get back quickly, everyone will have trouble.”[%p]
She kept repeating the same lines, like a broken audio player. Momose was starting to think it was time for a different approach.[%p]
She didn't know what would happen if she told the girl this[...] so she'd kept it a secret until now.[%p]
[name]Momose[line](But maybe I need to tell her[...] and make her face reality.)[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Please. I need to go back there.”[%p]
[name]Momose[line](I guess I don't have a choice. I'll try telling her.)[%p]
Once she made a decision, she didn't spend any time on second thoughts.[%p]
This was both an advantage and a disadvantage.[%p]
[name]Momose[line]“Listen, Uki?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Yes?”[%p]
[name]Momose[line]“If you really want to go back that badly, I can tell you something.”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Huh? You're letting me go back? Thank you.”[%p]
[name]Momose[line]“Listen to me. No matter how much you want to go back, it's impossible now.”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Impossible?”[%p]
[name]Momose[line]“Because the place you were in[...] that place under the hospital? It's gone now.”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Huh?”[%p]
Momose was relieved to finally see shock on Uki's face.[%p]
[name]Momose[line](Good[...] She does have normal feelings.)[%p]
Like Kunosato had said, they hadn't done any operations on her that would destroy her ability to experience emotions.[%p]
[name]Momose[line]“Right after you came here, that detective— you know, the young one who looks tired all the time? He said he went to that hospital.”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“[...]”[%p]
The girl simply listened to Momose speak, her eyes wide.[%p]
Momose kept talking, watching her carefully.[%p]
[name]Momose[line]“And he went to[...] the autopsy room, was it? And then to the basement, where you were.”[%p]
[name]Momose[line]“But there was nothing there, he said. The room you were in was empty.”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“But[...] then where did everyone go? What about all the people there?”[%p]
[name]Momose[line]“He said there was no one there.”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“No one?”[%p]
Uki seemed to be trying her best to understand what Momose just said.[%p]
And then—[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“You're lying[...]”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“You're lying[...] You're lying!”[%p]
[name]Momose[line]“Why would I lie? It's true.”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“But[...] But then what do I do?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“What[...] do I do?”[%p]
Tears started to silently fall from Uki's eyes.[%p]
