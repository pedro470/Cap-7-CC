[name]Miyashiro[line]“Hahh[...] hahh[...]aah[...]”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“You okay? Want me to take over for you, Takuru?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I-I’m fine. We’re almost there[...]hahh[...] hahh[...]”[%p]
When we finally made it back to Aoba Dorm, I took Uki off my back and put her on the sofa.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Hahh[...] hah[...] hah[...]”[%p]
And then I lay flat on the floor with my arms and legs stretched out.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](I hate to say it[...] but this is pathetic.)[%p]
She wasn’t even that heavy[...] I was just out of shape.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“I told you I’d take over[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Haha[...] If I let you do it, you’re so clumsy, you might drop her.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“How rude. I’m not that bad. And I think I’m in better shape than you are, Takuru.”[%p]
Kurusu’s eyes were red-rimmed.[%p]
Her face was red from where she’d tried to rub away the tears.[%p]
She must’ve been embarrassed by it, because she turned away from me and said something mean.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Right, right, whatever. We’ve gotta tell Dad about her.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Oh, yeah, you’re right.”[%p]
After Kurusu left to get him, I lifted my tired body off the floor and onto the sofa.[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“[...]”[%p]
As I’d expected, Uki hated the idea of leaving the basement.[%p]
But after Kurusu’s fervent attempts at persuasion, and my own insistence that nobody was coming back to the basement, she’d finally clung to Kurusu and started to break down.[%p]
And as I carried her on my back, she’d gotten tired and fallen asleep.[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Mm[...] mmm[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Where is her family? Her real home? What about her school?)[%p]
I hadn’t had a chance to look the first time we’d gone into the basement[...] and that data was probably long gone by now.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Dad says he's coming up.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Okay.”[%p]
Kurusu sat next to Uki on the sofa and softly stroked her hair.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“I wonder if there’s a missing person report for her.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Shinjo said he couldn’t find any data on her.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“I see.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“It might be because of the Shibuya quake.”[%p]
After the earthquake, more data on missing persons and casualties had gone missing than you could imagine.[%p]
And to top that off, this year had seen the largest solar storm in history affect all kinds of electronic devices.[%p]
Shibuya hadn’t been hit that hard, but a lot of data in other regions had been lost.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“All we know is her name, huh? If only she at least had some kind of clue[...]”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Big Sis Nono? Brother Takuru?”[%p]
[name]Yuto[line]“Is something wrong?”[%p]
The door opened. Yui and Yuto peeked inside.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Shh.”[%p]
[name]Tachibana Siblings[line]“Huh?”[linebreak][parallel]“Huh?”[%p]
The two of them froze next to the door.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“You two are still awake?”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“We were trying to sleep when we heard you talking.”[%p]
[name]Yuto[line]“Um[...] is everything okay? You’re not fighting again, are you?”[%p]
Kurusu and I looked at each other without thinking.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“W-We’re fine. We’re not fighting.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Really? I hope so, but[...]”[%p]
Suddenly, Yui stopped.[%p]
She saw the girl sleeping on the sofa, and her eyes went wide.[%p]
I thought that she was just surprised to see a strange girl sleeping on the sofa, but—[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Uki?”[%p]
She said something we’d never expected.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro and others[line]“Huh?”[linebreak][parallel]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“What is Uki doing here?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Y-Yui? You know her?”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Yeah[...] I think so. But wait[...] that’s impossible.”[%p]
Yui walked over to the sofa and sat down next to Kurusu.[%p]
And then she stared at Yamazoe Uki.[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“S-Sorry. I think I was wrong.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“No, you’re right. This girl’s name is Uki[...]”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“But that doesn’t make any sense. How can she look the exact same as she used to?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“As she used to?”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Uki was in my class[...] when I was in second grade.”[%p]
And the next morning—[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“We’ll go over this once more, okay? Her name is Yamazoe Uki. She’s the same age as you, Yui, so either 13 or 14.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Right.”[%p]
Dad was filling out what looked like a medical chart on his computer.[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“She was in Yui’s class in 2nd grade. But shortly before the earthquake, she stopped coming to school, and you don’t know what happened to her after that.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“And she hasn’t changed a bit since six years ago. Is that what you’re saying?”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Yes, I don’t think she’s changed at all.”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Hmm[...]”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“I found proof, too.”[%p]
Yui showed us a photo.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Oh!”[%p]
It was a class photo from her school.[%p]
I could see a young Yui in a row of children.[%p]
And in the front row, next to the teacher, I saw Uki.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Look!”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“What do you think, Takuru?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“It can’t just be someone who looks like her.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“That has to be Uki.”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Hmm[...] which means some kind of problem with her growth hormones, perhaps?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Everyone, Uki’s awake.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Really?!”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Okay, bring her in.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Wait, Dad?”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Mmm?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“No shouting in front of Uki. You have to be gentler.”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Huh? This is my normal voice, though.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Just be gentle!”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Okay.”[%p]
Dad glared at her and started mumbling about how he hadn’t raised her to be like this again.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Uki, you can come in now.”[%p]
After a long pause, a small girl entered the room, trembling.[%p]
Kurusu took her hand and walked her over to a chair, then sat her down.[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Uki, good morning!”[%p]
She flinched away from Yui’s cheerful voice.[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Um[...] uh[...]”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Oh, you don’t remember me, do you? You only know what I looked like six years ago.”[%p]
Yui took out the class photo and pointed to herself.[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“See? This is me.”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Tachibana Yui. Do you remember me?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Tachibana[...] Yui. Oh[...]”[%p]
Uki looked at the girl in the photo, then at Yui. Then she gave a little start of surprise.[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“You remember?!”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Oh, yes. Um[...] it’s been a long[...] time.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Aw, come on. We’re classmates. You don’t have to be so awkward.”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“B-But[...]”[%p]
Dad typed something else into his computer as he watched them.[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Hmm, that settles it, then.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
There was no question of it now.[%p]
Yamazoe Uki was definitely Yui’s old classmate.[%p]
That would go a long way toward tracking down her family.[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Anyway, that’s amazing. I still can’t believe it’s really you.”[%p]
We were surprised, but it seemed to be Yui who was most surprised of all.[%p]
Her missing classmate had suddenly shown up at her home, and her brother and sister had brought her there.[%p]
And she looked exactly the same as she had six years ago.[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Uki, can I ask you some things?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Oh, yes, sir.”[%p]
She must’ve seen dad’s white coat and gotten nervous, because she suddenly sat up straight.[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Have you ever been told you had a hereditary illness? Something that caused you to stop growing?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Umm[...] I don’t understand. I’m sorry.”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Then do you remember when you stopped getting taller? How was it when you were in Yui’s class?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“I’m sorry[...] I don’t know that either. But something weird happened to me after the earthquake[...]”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“I see. So it was after the earthquake.”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Yes[...]”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“I see[...] So PTSD-induced damage to the growth hormones. Or perhaps some kind of chromosomal abnormality, like [color index="280AA02D1400"]Turner syndrome[color index="800000"]?”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“I’d have to have a real specialist take a look at you[...]”[%p]
Dad made some adjustments to her chart as he whispered to himself. The look on his face was far more serious than he usually let us see.[%p]
[name]Yuto[line]“U-Um[...]”[%p]
Yuto poked his head through the door.[%p]
He must’ve been standing in the hallway the whole time and looking in on us.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Yuto? If you don’t get going, you’ll be late for school.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“That’s right, Yuu.”[%p]
[name]Yuto[line]“I[...] I’m fine. I’ll go in a second.”[%p]
He seemed a little scared by his sisters’ scolding.[%p]
But he summoned up his courage and came inside, then stuck his hand out toward Uki.[%p]
[name]Yuto[line]“Here, take this.”[%p]
In his hands was a tiny chocolate bar.[%p]
It was the kind of chocolate you could buy in huge packs for cheap at the supermarket.[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Huh? Oh, yes[...] Thank you.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Hey, Yuu. Uki is older than you. Don’t talk to her that way.”[%p]
[name]Yuto[line]“Older than me?”[%p]
Yuto looked very confused and a little unsatisfied.[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“What’s wrong, Uki?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Oh, it just feels a little strange[...] I’m not used to this.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“This?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Well[...] seeing a family get together and talk like this.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“What about your family?”[%p]
Shinjo had said that she wouldn't tell him anything[...] but maybe in this environment, she’d be more willing to talk.[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“When I was little[...] they left me with the doctors and went away.”[%p]
My eyes narrowed when I heard her say “the doctors.”[%p]
She was probably talking about the scientists in that underground facility.[%p]
And then she’d been a victim of their human experiments, just like Minamisawa Senri.[%p]
Why had her parents done something so horrible to her?[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“You stayed in that basement the whole time?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Yes.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Why didn’t you, well[...] run away?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Mother told me not to go anywhere.”[%p]
[name]Yui[line]“Th-That’s terrible.”[%p]
Yui put her hand up to her mouth.[%p]
I could feel the rage boiling over within me.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](She’s[...] just like me.)[%p]
Her parents had ignored her ever since she was a small child. And eventually, they’d just disappeared.[%p]
But still, she wasn’t able to get away from them.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“You were taking care of the victims— I mean, the people, there, right? Why?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Because of the earthquake.”[%p]
There was a sadness in her eyes as she remembered the people that had vanished.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“After the earthquake, the doctors went away. So did the nurses who cared for everyone.”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“So the hospital told me to take care of them instead.”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“What about school? You’re wearing the uniform for Hekiho Academy, right? At your age, you should be in the middle school.”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Hekiho[...] Academy?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Our school. You’re a student there, right?”[%p]
But Uki shook her head.[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“These belonged to a friend.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“A friend?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“At first, it wasn’t just me who was taking care of the people in the basement[...] I had a friend who was my age.”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Sometimes she wore these. And I always told her they were cute.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I see[...] did that girl come from the outside, then?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Yes.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I see. So she was the student at Hekiho.”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“At first, she worked alongside me, but she started to get sicker and sicker, and didn’t come as often[...] Then one day she gave me these as a present.”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“She said that she didn’t need them anymore, and that I should take good care of them.”[%p]
Uki looked down at her shoes.[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“So these clothes are very important to me. I always keep them clean and wear them all the time.”[%p]
When I saw her expression, I understood.[%p]
Her friend probably knew that she was dying. She’d been a victim of the same horrible experiments as Minamisawa and Uki, and had gotten sick as a result.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Then you took those old people out—”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Takuru?”[%p]
Kurusu interrupted me gently.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Let’s not ask too many questions at once, okay?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Oh[...]”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Uki, I know this has to be painful for you, so let’s talk about it more tonight instead, okay?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“You’re right.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“And we haven’t even eaten breakfast yet. You must be hungry, right?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“No, I’m not[...]”[%p]
There was a cute little rumble from her tummy.[%p]
She gasped a little in embarrassment and turned red.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Dad, that’s okay with you, right?”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Yeah. Hey, Uki? This girl may look scary, but her cooking’s top notch. Go upstairs and eat.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Dad[...]”[%p]
Kurusu pursed her lips as she took Uki’s hand and stood up.[%p]
[name]Yuto[line]“Oh, here. You can have another piece of chocolate.”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Thank you.”[%p]
As she left, Yuto quickly gave her another piece of chocolate.[%p]
