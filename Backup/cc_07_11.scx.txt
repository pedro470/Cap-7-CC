Just like we’d expected, nothing happened over the next few days.[%p]
There was no sign of that woman and no new arson cases, which meant no news about the case.[%p]
For my part, I was trying to figure out how to use my power to protect everyone, instead of just screwing around like I had before.[%p]
And then the day was upon us.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“So nothing’s happened so far, right?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Aren’t you glad, Miyashiro? It’s all because I’m hanging out with you. You can thank me by buying me a mango fruit parfait at Senzokuya, okay?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“What are you talking about? They might be after you, too.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Uwah! Cheapskate.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Listen, everyone. It’s too early to let your guard down. This is where things start to get tough.”[%p]
[name]Kazuki[line]“[...]”[%p]
Nothing had happened during school.[%p]
We’d made sure that nobody was alone during break periods, and it had paid off.[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“U-Um[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Mmm? What is it, Yamazoe?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Is it okay for me to be here? I’m not a student.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Today is special. You’re a psychic, too, so they might come after you.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“That’s right. Make sure you stay with us until today is over, okay?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Y-Yes, ma’am.”[%p]
Uki had seemed uncomfortable in this new environment all day.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“So what do we do now?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“People are starting to leave, so we should probably go somewhere else.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Let’s go to someplace in Shibuya that’s open late. You guys don’t mind coming with me, right?”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Oh, fine. But you’re paying.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Arimura, I might pay for the others, but you and I are going dutch.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“What? You’re mean! You’re a demon! A devil!”[%p]
Call me whatever you want.[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“So where do we go?”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Karaoke, maybe?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I’d rather go someplace cheap.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Mmm[...] So the usual place, then.”[%p]
[name]Girl[line]“Welcome. Take your time.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Thanks.”[%p]
[name]Girl[line]“You folks, huh? Sit wherever you like.”[%p]
We chose a seat by the window, with a good view.[%p]
Café LAX took over a whole floor of a classy two-story business building near Shibuya’s residential district.[%p]
With a window seat we could see all around the building, and we’d spot that pyrokinetic— Minamisawa Senri, if that’s who she was— immediately.[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“We can stay here till they close, huh?”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“We need to order a lot, then. Excuse me!”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Just saying this once more. Arimura, you’re paying for yourself.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Aw[...]”[%p]
[name]Girl[line]“Hmm? Are you ready to order? I’m busy, so make it quick.”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Um, ma’am, if you’re busy, I can help around the store[...]”[%p]
[name]Girl[line]“Huh?!”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Come on, Yamazoe. Customers don’t have to help the staff. Actually, you’re not allowed.”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“I’m not?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“You’re not.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Okay, I’ll take everything from here to here.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Arimura, don’t try to order the whole menu when I’m not looking. I’m not paying for your bill.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Aw[...]”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Ugh[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Onoe? What’s wrong?”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“The cream from the cream puff I just ate got in my hair[...]”[%p]
How could she pull that off with hair that length?[%p]
[name]Kazuki and others[line]“Fwaah[...]”[linebreak][parallel]“Gwaah[...]”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Hana, that’s a big yawn.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“You too, Itou. Come on man, stay sharp.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“And it’s bad manners, too.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“I can’t help it. We’ve been here for hours, just killing time.”[%p]
[name]Kazuki[line]“Mmm[...]”[%p]
We’d been at Café LAX for 4 hours already.[%p]
At first, everyone had been tense and alert, but it seemed we were starting to hit our limits.[%p]
Arimura and I seemed to be relaxing a little.[%p]
If we were alone, we would’ve been afraid. But now we were surrounded by our friends.[%p]
And if you added in the waitress and the other customers, there were even more people here now. I couldn’t imagine someone just barging in and attacking.[%p]
[name]Girl[line]“Hey, you. You people.”[%p]
The waitress had walked over at some point while I was looking out the window, and was standing next to me.[%p]
[name]Girl[line]“How many hours are you planning on staying here? If you’re not going to order more[...]”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Oh, we will! We’ll order. Give me a menu.”[%p]
I guess we had to order extra after all.[%p]
It was only natural, but it was putting a big dent in my budget for the month.[%p]
[name]Girl[line]“Here, have a menu.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Thanks. Taku, what do you want?”[%p]
Serika took the menu and handed it to me.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Hmm, let me see[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Something cheap, something cheap[...])[%p]
As I flipped through the menu, I saw—[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh[...]”[%p]
T-That’s[...]![%p]
That’s a Sumo Sticker![%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“—!”[%p]
I felt horribly dizzy, and my eyes started to go blurry.[%p]
I felt[...] bad. It hurt to breathe.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Ugggh[...] it’s the same as that night.)[%p]
The 11th Rorschach, which had tortured Arimura and I on the night we were attacked by the pyrokinetic, was right in front of me.[%p]
Everything started to go dim.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](No[...] not now!)[%p]
Stay strong. Don’t lose it.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Hahh[...]hahh[...] hahh[...] hahh[...]”[%p]
Don’t lose it![%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Aah!”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]hahh[...] haah[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Hahh[...] hahh[...] haah[...]”[%p]
Okay, I managed to get a hold of myself.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“?!”[%p]
What?! Where did everybody go?![%p]
That made no sense[...] How?![%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Kurusu? Onoe? Itou?”[%p]
Where[...][%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Kazuki? Arimura? Yamazoe?”[%p]
They were gone![%p]
Not only my friends, but even the waitress had disappeared![%p]
Everybody was gone![%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](This can’t be happening[...])[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Hello? Is anybody there?”[%p]
I called out to the back of the café, but there was no sign that anyone was there.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Damn it! What’s going on?!”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]?!”[%p]
T-This sound—[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](This sound is[...])[%p]
All the sound had disappeared from the world.[%p]
The music that had been playing in the café was gone, and so were the sounds of the cars that sometimes passed by on the road.[%p]
There was nothing but strange silence and dark gloom.[%p]
I could only hear one thing.[%p]
That terrifying sound—[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Aah!”[%p]
She was getting closer![%p]
The footsteps were coming up the stairs to the café![%p]
Shivering with fear, I forced myself to quietly open the door to the café, and then snuck out onto the landing.[%p]
Trembling, I looked down the stairs to the first floor.[%p]
And there I saw—[%p]
[name]Minamisawa[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Aah[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](T-That’s[...])[%p]
[name]Minamisawa[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](UWWAAAAAHH!)[%p]
Our eyes met![%p]
Our eyes met for an instant![%p]
I saw those eyes, like cold fire, looking up at me from beneath the hair that covered her whole face.[%p]
I knew it. That was[...][%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](That’s the pyrokinetic from before[...] Minamisawa Senri!)[%p]
As if she could sense my fear[...][%p]
[name]Minamisawa[line]“[...]”[%p]
Minamisawa Senri looked at me and smiled.[%p]
It was the smile of a beast that had found its prey.[%p]
[name]Minamisawa[line]“I found you[...]”[%p]
