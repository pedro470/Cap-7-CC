[name]Sakuma[line]“Hmm[...]”[%p]
Sunday.[%p]
Arimura, Uki, and I got a full medical check at a hospital run by a friend of my dad’s, just like Shinjo had suggested.[%p]
And now the numbers, brain waves, electrocardiographs, MRIs and other images were lined up on Dad’s computer screen.[%p]
Of course, as a complete amateur, I had no idea what any of it meant.[%p]
Kunosato was talking to my dad as if she were a colleague, rather than addressing him as the much older man that he was.[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“What do you mean you found something strange? I’m already pissed off that I have to do this exam. And I’m supposed to meet with some friends today.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“When a girl blows off another girl, it makes things complicated down the road.”[%p]
Arimura put her hands on her hips and complained.[%p]
Uki, for her part, looked scared. She was hiding behind me and trying to stay out of Kunosato’s sight.[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“You don’t know anything, and you need to shut up. You’re getting in the way.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“What? No way! If I don’t make things clear now, who knows what you’re going to do in the future?”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“Tch. Amateurs like you piss me off the most.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Hey, Arimura, Kunosato. Don’t you ever get tired of fighting all day?”[%p]
Shinjo sighed, like he always did.[%p]
Arimura’s eyes narrowed as she glared at Kunosato, who just laughed.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Haah[...] So, Dr. Sakuma, what did you find?”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“If you found something, tell me as fast as you can. I want to go shopping after this.”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Sure, I will. First, as for why Uki stopped growing[...] We won’t know for a while. It’ll take time to get results back on her chromosomal and hormone tests.”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“And as for you two, you’re in fine health. No issues with any of your internal organs.”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“But Takuru is showing clear signs of eating an unbalanced diet. Certain nutrients are very clearly missing. I’ll make this very clear to Nono.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Gah!”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“And you, Arimura, need to cut back on the sweets and fatty foods. No junk food. You’re on a straight path toward obesity right now.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Gah!”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“Enough about their bodies. What about their brains?”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Yes, well, this is an MRI scan[...]”[%p]
Dad clicked on one of the images, which displayed images of a human brain.[%p]
Arimura must’ve found the sight of her own brain creepy, because she looked away. Uki didn’t seem to know what it was, and stared out from behind me, confused.[%p]
Kunosato clicked through the images slowly, checking each little part in turn, but then finally tossed it away.[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“All three of them are negative, aren’t they?”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Yeah, this MRI shows negative.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Negative? What? Does that mean I’m stupid?!”[%p]
Arimura staggered back as if she’d been given some kind of shocking news.[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“Mmm? Yes, you’re stupid. Extremely stupid.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Aw[...] no way!”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“No, no. That’s not what the word means.”[%p]
Dad chuckled a little.[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Kunosato, you’re an even meaner person than I’d been told.”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“If she doesn’t know what negative means, then I’d say calling her stupid is fair.”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Haha[...] I see what Shinjo’s going through.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Right?”[%p]
Shinjo gave Dad a tired smile.[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Don’t worry. Negative in the medical sense is a good thing. It means there’s no unusual symptoms.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Your brain is completely normal.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“O-Oh! You scared me[...]”[%p]
Arimura sighed with relief, for once acting like a girl her age.[%p]
Lately, I’d finally understood that this was who she really was.[%p]
She’d once told me before that she was always trying to be the person that the people around her wanted her to be.[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“So there’s no relationship between the Gigalomaniacs' power and the enlargement seen in the brain?”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“I can tell you, at least, that I’m not seeing any issues with them on these charts. Decide for yourself what that means in relation to that[...] Gigalo-whatists you’re talking about.”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“[...]”[%p]
Kunosato frowned and thought.[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“But there was a commonality between all the murder victims. Their brains all showed the same symptoms.”[%p]
Kunosato showed Dad her tablet computer.[%p]
It had several brains on it that weren’t ours. Arimura looked away again.[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“You can tell from looking at this, right? The cerebral neocortex is swollen.”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“Hmm[...] You’re right, now that you mention it,”[%p]
Dad whispered as he looked at the tablet.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Swollen? It’s bigger?”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“That’s right.”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“About 1.2 times normal size[...] so we wanted to see if your brains show the same symptoms.”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“But the result was negative. Your brains are no different than a normal person’s.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Which means something happened to the victims that caused their brains to swell?”[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“I don’t know about that. This isn’t large enough to cause a problem with their daily lives. It wouldn’t affect them mentally, either. They probably didn’t even notice it.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“In other words, their brains were like that originally, or this happened to them when they died[...] or perhaps, this is what killed them. We don’t know.”[%p]
Dad looked at the tablet and nodded.[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“That’s right.”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“Either way, we don’t have enough data to make a decision. If we only had two or three more victims[...]”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“I told you, stop saying that.”[%p]
Shinjo treated it like a joke, but her face was completely serious and terrifying.[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“So does that mean there wasn’t any real point to this exam? You’re kidding me.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“No, that’s not true. Knowing that you’re healthy and your brain is fine is a blessing, right?”[%p]
Shinjo tried his best to make her feel better, but[...][%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Don’t say things to me that you don’t mean.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“You were just thinking, ‘This is why Arimura is such a hassle,’ just now, weren’t you?”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“That’s not true[...] oops.”[%p]
Shinjo gave up and lowered his head.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Sorry.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Man, what a waste of a day off. I’m leaving.”[%p]
Arimura grabbed her bag and tried to leave.[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“Wait a moment.”[%p]
But she turned around at the door when Kunosato stopped her.[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“What is it?”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“Help me with one more thing. I need your power.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“No.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“I told you, Kunosato, there’s a right way to ask for things.”[%p]
But Kunosato ignored him.[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“I want to ask Yamazoe Uki about her powers.”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“What?”[%p]
Uki shivered and hid behind me.[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“[...]”[%p]
Dad saw her and frowned in a way that only I could notice.[%p]
Then he said, “I’m gonna hit the restroom,” and walked past Arimura and out the door.[%p]
—On the way out, he whispered to me.[%p]
[name]Sakuma[line]“I’m going to leave for a bit. Psychic powers are outside my field of study as a doctor. Just listening to this makes me think I’m going to go crazy.”[%p]
After Dad left, Kunosato looked at tiny little Uki with cold eyes.[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“Yamazoe, you don’t seem to know the details yourself, so just tell me what you know.”[%p]
Her harsh tone only scared Uki more, but I looked at her and nodded, and she tried her best to work up her courage.[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“I[...] I[...] I think I have the power to make what someone imagines into reality[...] I guess.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“What someone imagines?”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“Can that someone be anyone?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“A-Anyone near me.”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“Can it be anything? For instance[...] if I imagine this coin.”[%p]
Kunosato took out a penny and showed it to Uki.[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“I-It can be things like that[...] or not.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“What do you mean by 'not'?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“I don’t know how to describe it[...] ‘situations,' maybe?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Situations?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Like, they want to be pretty, or they want something to happen?”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“And that becomes real?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Is it real? I don’t really know.”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“Could you do it now if you wanted to?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“N-No[...] I can’t do it whenever I want to.”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“Well, Arimura?”[%p]
Kunosato looked over, but Arimura just turned her head.[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Right, right. She’s not lying. It’s all true, I guess.”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“Hmm. So she subconsciously real boots the wishes and thoughts of other people.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“I see. That explains how she disappeared from Freesia. What Momose was thinking about got real booted[...]”[%p]
So her power could only real boot other people’s thoughts and wishes, not her own?[%p]
It was like her own life. She had no hopes of her own, and only lived her life for the sake of others. In a way, it was a very sad power.[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“If it happens whether you want it to or not, then it’s similar to Arimura Hinae’s power. The power itself is impressive[...] but inconvenient.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Hmph. Sorry I’m inconvenient.”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“So when did this start, Yamazoe?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“‘When did you get this power?’ is what I’m asking. Was it during the experiments in the underground facility?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“N-No[...] I was a bad student.”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“Then when?”[%p]
[name]Yamazoe[line]“Um[...] I think it was after the Shibuya earthquake.”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“I thought so.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Why’s that?”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“I looked into what they said, and what you found about the victims' pasts. When you put it together, they all awoke to their powers at almost the exact same time.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“So the earthquake was the cause?”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“That’s still just a theory, unfortunately.”[%p]
Kunosato started to type something into her tablet.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Wait. Earthquakes happen all the time. If every one created a Gigalomaniac, we’d be overflowing with them.”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“No, I’m not talking about the earthquake itself.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“You remember that something strange was observed in Shibuya during the quake, right?”[%p]
Something strange?[%p]
I did remember, actually.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Do you mean that white light?”[%p]
Kunosato nodded.[%p]
—That white light.[%p]
The white light that had covered us right after the Shibuya earthquake.[%p]
There were a lot of rumors about it, including one that said it was plasma caused by the earthquake. But I’d heard they still didn’t really know what it was.[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“I’m surprised. I didn’t take you for a conspiracy theorist, Kunosato.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“What conspiracy theory? Wait, do you mean the one from after the quake?”[%p]
I was talking about a certain rumor that had gone around right after the earthquake.[%p]
The rumor said that the quake was caused by a secret [color index="280AA02D1400"]tectonic weapon[color index="800000"] experiment, a joint project between the US and Japan, that might have gone awry.[%p]
And that the mysterious light was caused by its explosion.[%p]
And that Chaos Child Syndrome, which was believed to be a form of PTSD, might actually be caused by the materials used in that weapon.[%p]
The rumor was popular on @channel for a while, but people quickly got bored with it. By the time I’d woken up from my coma, no one was talking about it anymore.[%p]
No, it would be more accurate to say that instead of people getting bored, someone had done their best to erase all traces of it.[%p]
At the time, I’d found this strange, and started looking into it outside of the internet.[%p]
Despite the large magnitude of the quake, there’d been no aftershocks afterward. All the damage had been concentrated in Shibuya, and the epicenter had been observed to be far too shallow.[%p]
Despite all this, not a single scientist was speaking up.[%p]
Whenever someone raised even the smallest doubt, they were quickly shouted down as an idiot conspiracy theorist.[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“I wish it was just a conspiracy theory.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“What do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“I think that light might’ve been the cause of everything. The earthquake was just a side effect of it.”[%p]
[name]Shinjo[line]“Are you serious? Then what do you think that light was?”[%p]
[name]Kunosato[line]“If I knew, my life would be a whole lot easier. But I’m sure that someone caused it.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Oh, I’m sorry. Can you figure that out some other time? All I want is for you to solve the case, and soon.”[%p]
Arimura saw that Shinjo and Kunosato were about to start arguing and readjusted her tote bag on her shoulder.[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“I’m finished here, right? Then goodbye. See you at school, most of you.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Y-Yeah. Bye.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“See you around, Uki. And cheer up.”[%p]
She patted Uki lightly on the head and left the examination room.[%p]
Uki softly whispered, “Yes, ma’am,” as she watched her go.[%p]
After that, Kunosato began to mumble to herself as she started to look at our data on Dad’s PC.[%p]
There was a different look in her eyes than any I’d seen before. To be honest, she looked a little crazy.[%p]
It wasn’t like a mad scientist.[%p]
It was[...] as if she was concealing some dark obsession.[%p]
I’d seen these eyes somewhere before.[%p]
Where was it?[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Oh!)[%p]
I remembered and shivered.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](That pyrokinetic. That girl who might be Minamisawa Senri[...] They look just like her eyes.)[%p]
They were the eyes of someone bent on revenge, and consumed by hatred and rage.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
The Shibuya earthquake and the strange light[...][%p]
And the relationship they had with our powers.[%p]
I rolled around in my bed, thinking about everything that had happened.[%p]
And then I thought back to the crazy look in Kunosato’s eyes.[%p]
She looked just like the pyrokinetic.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Revenge, huh?)[%p]
Did Minamisawa Senri hate me for what I’d done that day?[%p]
Did she still hate me even now?[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“That’s crazy. I was a little kid. There’s no way she’d still be mad about something that happened so long ago—”[%p]
I tried to say it aloud to convince myself.[%p]
(But that pyrokinetic wasn’t behaving like a normal person.)[%p]
It was hard to think she was sane.[%p]
She was a beast, an animal without a conscience that was stalking the streets of Shibuya with bared fangs. At least, that’s how she had seemed to me.[%p]
And the terrifying words she’d said when she saw me[...][%p]
She looked at me, and she said,[%p]
“I found you.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Did I end up putting my life at risk, and not even realize it?)[%p]
The more I thought about it, the more my blood began to run cold.[%p]
If I’d known this was going to happen, I would’ve just listened to Kurusu to begin with.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Wait, why am I acting so wimpy?”[%p]
I sat up on the bed.[%p]
That’s right. I had my power.[%p]
Even if that woman was Minamisawa Senri[...] and she was trying to kill me out of revenge, I wouldn’t just sit there and let her.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](But[...])[%p]
What if she attacked me when I was with Kurusu?[%p]
And what if things got so dangerous that I couldn’t protect my own life, or Kurusu’s, without killing her?[%p]
Could I kill Minamisawa Senri right in front of Kurusu?[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“—!”[%p]
I almost leapt up at the sudden noise.[%p]
The sound was from my new smartphone.[%p]
I’d finally gotten a new one before I went to the hospital today. I’d totally forgotten.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
I remembered how Itou had gotten a call from my old phone after I’d lost it, and hesitated a little.[%p]
I looked at the screen, trembling.[%p]
Caller: Onoe Serika.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Oh, it’s just Onoe[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Hello?”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Oh, Taku? Hey!”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“What’s up?”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Hmm? Are you in a bad mood? Did something happen at your exam?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“No, that’s not it.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“You can’t fool me, okay? Whenever your voice is like that, you’re worried about something.”[%p]
Evidently it wasn’t just Kurusu and Arimura who could tell when I was lying.[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“So? What is it?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
I wasn’t sure if I should tell her, but it was Serika I was talking to, after all.[%p]
I told her everything I’d been thinking about.[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Hmm[...] a white light?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I was with you then, wasn’t I? Do you remember anything?”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Well, I was out cold, so I didn’t see it. Remember, you carried me to the hospital.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Oh, that’s right.”[%p]
I could still remember how Serika felt when I’d carried her on my back.[%p]
Until then, I hadn’t really treated her differently than any other boy. But at some point, she’d started to grow into a woman.[%p]
When I carried her on my back, I was surprised. That was what a girl felt like.[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Sorry about making you do that. Thanks.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Wh-Why bring that up now? You know we’re friends.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Heheheh. It’s nice to have an old friend, isn’t it?”[%p]
Serika sounded happy, but the tone of her voice quickly dropped.[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Oh, but[...] that girl who’s Non’s old friend is causing you a lot of problems right now, isn’t she?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“You be careful, too. I wasn’t the only one who saw Minamisawa Senri down there.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Mmm, it’ll be fine. I’m sure you’ll protect me.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Huh? Are you not planning on protecting me?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“No, no. That’s not it. Just[...]”[%p]
I fell silent, but I could tell that Serika was nodding to herself on the other side of the phone.[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Oh, I see. So that’s why you’re not sure what to do.”[%p]
And then, even though I hadn’t said anything, she seemed to realize my problem. Could I kill someone if it meant saving someone?[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Hmm[...] but you know, Taku?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Mmm?”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“I think that even if it were her best friend, Non would kill them without a second thought if she had to do it to protect you.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Oh[...]”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Of course, I would, too. I’d do anything for you. And I don’t think I’d lose to anyone. Ever.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Onoe[...]”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“What about you, Taku?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
Maybe she was right.[%p]
Kurusu would probably kill her friend if it was the only way to protect us.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](But I can’t let Kurusu do that.)[%p]
If that woman really was Minamisawa Senri[...] It wasn’t Kurusu who needed to do it.[%p]
It was me, right?[%p]
That’s right. That was the way to overcome my past trauma, too.[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Oh, but today’s the 18th, right?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Why is that important?”[%p]
Following Serika’s conversations was as impossible as ever.[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Oh, I was just thinking that the next murder won’t be for a while.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“It won’t?”[%p]
I looked at the calendar, and then realized.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“The next is the 23rd, huh?”[%p]
If these killings were following the New Generation Madness, the next murder would be on the 23rd.[%p]
After that would be Yummy Hand on October 28th, and DQN Puzzle on the 4th of November. If we could get through the 23rd, we’d be safe for a while.[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Yup. So we may be safe until then.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“But that means we’ll have to spend the whole day running on the 23rd.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Then let’s all stay together that day.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Even if she hates you, I don’t think she can just show up when we’re all together.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I see[...] That might be our only plan, yeah.”[%p]
If we could avoid the murderer that way, we'd win.[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“We could have everyone in the club help, and go to some place that’s open all night. Or if Dr. Sakuma says it’s okay, we could stay at Aoba Dorm.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Onoe, you’re smarter than you look.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Huh? Heheheh, that’s a big compliment.”[%p]
No, no it’s not.[%p]
It’s not a compliment at all.[%p]
But whenever I was in trouble or worried about something, Serika had always been there to listen.[%p]
She was one of the few people who really understood me.[%p]
Of course, I was too embarrassed to tell her that, and I had no plans to ever do so.[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Okay, Taku. Goodnight. Sweet dreams!”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Yeah, goodnight.”[%p]
I hung up and then looked at the calendar on the wall again.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“October 23rd.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“What’s the killer going to do?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Is it really some kind of message?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“And am I really the target?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Or[...]”[%p]
