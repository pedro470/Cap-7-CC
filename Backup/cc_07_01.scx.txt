[name]Itou[line]“Hey, Miyashiro, you're going to the club today, right?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Of course. I want to go over a lot of things with the case.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Okay, let's go.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Oh, sorry. Go on ahead without me.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“What, you've got something to do?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Well, I'm on cleaning duty today.”[%p]
I pointed to the other students who were moving the desks and sweeping the floors.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Yeah[...] but you know, why do they make the students do the cleaning?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“You've got that right. It's only a few countries, including Japan, that make their students do the cleaning—”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Oh, stop. Stop. I don't need to hear it. Okay, see you later.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Oh[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Sheesh[...]”[%p]
Time to get this finished and head to the club room.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Mmm?”[%p]
I saw a scrap of paper lying on the floor next to the garbage bin.[%p]
Someone had probably tried to throw it in the wastebasket and missed, then left it there. I really wished they'd think about the people that had to do the cleaning before they did that.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
I took a quick look around.[%p]
There was another student named Tanaka right nearby, who was mopping up the floor.[%p]
Fortunately, there was no one else around.[%p]
Okay[...] let's try this.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](—!)[%p]
I visualized the scrap of paper lifting off the ground.[%p]
This was more difficult than you'd think. If you lost your concentration for even a moment, it wouldn’t work.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Well?! Can I do it?!)[%p]
I took the scene I'd imagined and tried to strike Tanaka with it.[%p]
And then—[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Yes!)[%p]
The scrap of paper floated upward, just like I'd imagined.[%p]
And then it floated into the garbage can.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Nice.)[%p]
I did a little victory pose.[%p]
[name]Tanaka[line]“H-Huh?”[%p]
Tanaka was looking around in surprise.[%p]
She looked at me, a little afraid.[%p]
[name]Tanaka[line]“H-Hey, Miyashiro?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Y-Yes? W-What is it?”[%p]
[name]Tanaka[line]“Did I just see a piece of paper move into the garbage can on its own?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Tanaka[line]“Like[...] you know, it went in without anybody touching it.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh? No way. You must've been mistaken.”[%p]
[name]Tanaka[line]“Oh, yeah[...] I guess you're right. Ahaha.”[%p]
Still, she stared at the garbage can, unsatisfied.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“U-Um[...] I'd like to go throw out the garbage. Is that okay?”[%p]
[name]Tanaka[line]“Huh? Y-Yeah. Sorry.”[%p]
I took the garbage can out into the hallway.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Whew[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](More[...] I want to use this power more[...]!)[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Everybody here?”[%p]
It had already been three days since Arimura and I had been attacked by the pyrokinetic.[%p]
We'd been worried that she might attack us again[...] But until now, nothing had happened.[%p]
Thanks to that, we'd finally calmed down, and today I was feeling good enough to revisit what we knew about the case.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“First, before we get started, let me introduce you—”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Hey there! I'm Arimura Hinae, and I'm always smiling! It’s so nice to meet you all!”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Nice to meet you, too! Clap, clap, clap!”[%p]
It was still hard to keep up with the way her mood seemed to change all the time.[%p]
Serika was applauding, but no one else was.[%p]
[name]Kazuki[line]“[...]”[%p]
Kazuki was playing ESO2 or some other game, like she always did. She turned around to take one look at Arimura, then went back to her computer screen[...][%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Umm[...] Arimura isn't actually joining the newspaper club. She's just helping us.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“I'm in the lit club, actually, but there's no need to sweat the details. I'll be coming by as much as I can.”[%p]
For what it's worth, I'd already told all the newspaper club members about Arimura's power.[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Hey, hey, Hina, can I ask you something?”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Sure. Oh, but my measurements are a maiden's secret!”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“I don't really know if I care about Arimura's measurements.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“The hell did you just say, asshole?”[%p]
And then her mood changed again.[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Which is the real you, Hina? Sometimes you're cheerful and sometimes you're serious, and sometimes you're scared[...]”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Well, which do you think it is?”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Hmm? Hmm[...]? Mmm[...]?”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Ahaha, come on. You don't have to think about it that hard.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“But what I can tell you is that knowing when somebody's telling the truth is a lot harder than you think, Seri. If you don't mess around a little, you can't survive.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Hmm?”[%p]
Serika seemed lost in thought, as if she didn't really understand.[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Oh, right. You!”[%p]
[name]Kazuki[line]“[...]”[%p]
Kazuki jumped a little.[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Hey, hey, you. You're a first-year, right?”[%p]
[name]Kazuki[line]“Mm[...] mmm.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Oh, sorry. Can you say that out loud for me?”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Oh, Hina. Don't say that. Hana doesn't talk.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Huh? She doesn't?”[%p]
[name]Kazuki[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Hmm[...] Do you mean she can't talk?”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“No[...] I don't think that's the case. She just really doesn't want to.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Even we've never actually seen her talk.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Huh, I see.”[%p]
Arimura stared at Kazuki's face.[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Okay, okay, um[...] Kazuki Hana, right? So can I call you Hana?”[%p]
[name]Kazuki[line]“Mmm[...]”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Okay, Hana. Nice to meet you!”[%p]
I'd thought Arimura might've found it difficult to get along with Kazuki, but maybe I was wrong.[%p]
Since Kazuki didn't talk, it might actually make it easier for her, since she didn't have to worry about knowing if she was lying.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Okay, let's get started.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Wait. Before that, there's something I have to tell you. Kurusu is[...]”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Sorry I'm late.”[%p]
Kurusu opened the door and came inside.[%p]
Her injury had healed, and Dad had told her that it was okay for her to move around. So she'd come back to school today.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Geh, Vice President[...]”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Have you started already?”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“No, we definitely haven't been talking about the case—”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“It's okay, Itou.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Kurusu is going to help us solve the case.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Huh? She is?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Yes. I guess you could say it's my job to keep an eye on you.”[%p]
Kurusu glanced at me for just a moment, worried.[%p]
But it was only for a moment, and then she was back to normal.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Anyway, let me hear your opinions on the case thus far. If there's anything that's even a little off, I'll gladly point it out.”[%p]
The meek attitude she'd had when she'd been hurt was gone, and she was back to her usual self— Itou's shoulders slumped, but at the same time, he looked a little happy.[%p]
She was always obnoxious, and at times a little annoying[...] but this is the way everyone wanted Kurusu to be.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Okay, now that everyone's here, I'd like to start the meeting. But first, there's something I want to show you all.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Mmm? What's that?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I've only shown this to Onoe and Kurusu so far. It doesn't work 100% of the time, so it might fail, but[...]”[%p]
[name]All[line]“[...]?”[linebreak][parallel]“[...]?”[linebreak][parallel]“[...]?”[%p]
Itou, Kazuki, and Arimura looked at me in confusion.[%p]
I nodded and grabbed a pen, then put it on the table.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
I tried my best to focus.[%p]
And then just like the scrap of paper earlier, I imagined the pen moving.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Here's the hard part[...] Can I do it?)[%p]
As I focused as hard as I could, I saw it slowly appear in the corner of my eye—[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Okay, there it is!)[%p]
Now all that was left was to imagine my delusion infecting everyone else.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]!”[%p]
The next moment, the pen started to jerk upward.[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Huh?!”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Whoa!”[%p]
[name]Kazuki[line]“Hmm[...]?”[%p]
The three of them raised their voices in surprise as the pen slowly moved upward.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Whew[...]”[%p]
When I stopped imagining the floating pen, the Di-Sword disappeared from my field of vision, and the pen slammed back down on the table.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“W-Wow, Miyashiro! That's incredible!”[%p]
[name]Kazuki[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Just like I said, it's not perfect yet, but[...]”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“When did you learn to do that?!”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Onoe helped me try a bunch of different things.”[%p]
Itou gasped in amazement.[%p]
When the pyrokinetic attacked me, I was forced to accept that I really was a psychic.[%p]
After that, I'd decided to master my power instead of running away from it. And I'd gone through a lot of trial and error to do so.[%p]
At first, I tried to do it on my own, but that didn't go well.[%p]
And then I remembered what Kunosato had said.[%p]
She'd said that a Gigalomaniac accomplished a real boot by transmitting his delusions into the dead spots of another person's brain, to create what she'd called a “shared reality.”[%p]
That meant that if I didn't have someone to share my delusion with, it wouldn't work, right?[%p]
So when I'd started practicing with Serika, things began to go much better.[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“But Miyashiro, you know that if you start using that power for fun, nothing good's going to come of it, right?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Arimura's right.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I-I know that. I'm just doing this to protect everyone.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Hmph. I hope so[...]”[%p]
I was telling the truth.[%p]
I'd managed to turn back the pyrokinetic's flames at the last second.[%p]
That was the only reason we survived.[%p]
But that was only a coincidence, born out of desperation.[%p]
If she was going to come after me again, I needed to master my power.[%p]
That's why I'd decided to practice like this.[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“But you know, it's weird[...]”[%p]
Suddenly Serika frowned.[%p]
She was fiddling with her Gero Froggy strap, like she always did when she was thinking about something.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“What's weird?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“You know, Serika, you may be able to make sense of what you're saying inside your own head, but the rest of us can't.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Oh, sorry, sorry. Well, Hina can tell if someone's telling the truth, right? And Taku can move objects[...]”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“I was just wondering why everybody has different powers.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Oh[...]”[%p]
I'd never thought about that before. She had a point.[%p]
Why did different people have different powers?[%p]
Kunosato hadn't said anything about that.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“And another thing, when did you get this power? Were you born with it?”[%p]
That was another thing I'd been wondering about.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Miyashiro, what about you?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I didn't know that I had this power until a very short time ago. So honestly, I don't know.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Then what about you, Arimura?”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“I think mine came to me after the Shibuya earthquake. After that, I just suddenly could tell when people were lying.”[%p]
So in Arimura's case, she'd suddenly become able to tell if people were lying after the Shibuya earthquake.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Does that mean that the earthquake is involved somehow?)[%p]
I'd have to look into that eventually.[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Also, as to Seri's question— why different people have different powers— I have an idea about that.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“What is it?”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“I think it’s because of their wish.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Their wish?”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Yup. Something happened to me during the earthquake, and the next thing I knew, I was like this.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Something happened?”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Aw, come on. You know, I wanted to know the truth. Don't make me spell it out. It's embarrassing.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“No, it's not really embarrassing.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“And what do you mean, you wanted to know the truth? What happened?”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Jeez, you're such a nosy pervert.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“W-Why?!”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Call it a maiden's secret. So no more questions! None!”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
When Arimura was like this, I knew I wasn't going to get anything out of her.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“A-Anyway, let's go over what's happened so far.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“All the victims in the Return of the New Generation Madness cases have one thing in common.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“We know what that is, right?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Yup. Just like I guessed before, they were all psychics.”[%18]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“The first victim, in the Don't Look at Me case—”[%18]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“The first victim, in the Don't Look at Me case—”[%18]
No, that's wrong.[%p]
Think about this again. That's not it.[%p]
No, that's not right.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Yes, he could probably see the future.”[%18]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Next, the Leaky Noise victim. She—”[%18]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Next, the Leaky Noise victim. She—”[%18]
No, that's wrong.[%p]
Think about this again. That's not it.[%p]
No, that's not right.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Trance[...] you mean, like, anybody listening to her felt really good?”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Yeah, probably something like that.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“In other words, she was able to control how people felt with her music.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Next, the victim in the Revolving Dead case. He—”[%18]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Next, the victim in the Revolving Dead case. He—”[%18]
No, that's wrong.[%p]
Think about this again. That's not it.[%p]
No, that's not right.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I think this Kakita guy was a telepath.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Yes, that's right. That's what he said to me.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“And as for the victim in the Gottsuan Death case—”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“That's right. All of Watabe's famous scoops were taken from angles and places that should be impossible. He was probably using psychic photography.”[%18]
[name]Arimura[line]“So it's just like I said. Don't you get the sense that all these powers have a wish involved?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“A wish, huh?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Ootani, the victim in the Don't Look at Me case, was a Niconiya streamer that[...]”[%18]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Ootani, the victim in the Don't Look at Me case, was a Niconiya streamer that[...]”[%18]
No, that's wrong.[%p]
Think about this again. That's not it.[%p]
No, that's not right.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“From what Shinjo said about Takayanagi, the girl in the Leaky Noise case, she[...]”[%18]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“From what Shinjo said about Takayanagi, the girl in the Leaky Noise case, she[...]”[%18]
No, that's wrong.[%p]
Think about this again. That's not it.[%p]
No, that's not right.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Kakita, from the Revolving Dead Case[...] him, I don't know. Arimura, do you know anything?”[%18]
[name]Arimura[line]“He didn't talk about it much. I guess there was a lot of backstabbing at his job.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“But once he got his power, he didn't have to worry about that anymore.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“And as for Watabe, from the Gottsuan Death case[...]”[%18]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I see. Looking at it, you may be right.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“In other words, their wishes had an effect on their powers?”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Does that mean that your power comes from a wish, too, Miyashiro?”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Have you ever wanted to be able to move things without touching them?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“No, I[...]”[%p]
I couldn't think of any reason why I'd want that power.[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Oh, I think I know. Taku. Remember after the earthquake, when you were in a coma for so long?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Oh[...]”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Come to think of it, you had a really hard time even walking back then.”[%p]
Just like Kurusu said, I'd been badly injured during the earthquake.[%p]
Even after I'd finally woken up from my coma, just walking was incredibly painful.[%p]
It was bad enough that it would take tens of minutes just to grab something a few feet away.[%p]
I'd hated that, and I'd wished a thousand times that the thing I was trying to get would just come to me.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Then that's where my power came from?)[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Makes sense. We can assume your theory that these powers come from wishes is right, then.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Then that woman— the one who attacked us— her power comes from some wish too?”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Did she want to burn something?”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“What could she want to burn so badly?”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Maybe she wanted to roast yams?”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Is this really a time to be telling jokes?”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“No, Itou. Seri seriously believes that.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Seriously?”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Huh? Did I say something strange?”[%p]
Yeah[...] Yeah you did, Serika.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Well, whatever. We can worry about why she became a pyrokinetic another time.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“There's one other problem we have to think about with her. Something important.”[%p]
I looked at the faces of everyone in the room.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Whether she's behind all the murders so far.”[%p]
She had clearly been trying to kill us.[%p]
But that didn't mean that she was behind all the murders.[%p]
I looked back at the board.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Kazuki, get the thing I asked for.”[%p]
[name]Kazuki[line]“Mmm[...]”[%p]
I took the image that I'd asked Kazuki to print out for me.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Nobody's been talking about it because of the Return of the New Generation Madness, but there's been a string of recent arson cases in Shibuya.”[%p]
Everyone seemed to know this. They nodded.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I'm going to compare the arson sites with the locations of the murders so far.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“First, here's where the Don't Look at Me case took place.”[%18]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“And here's where the arson was.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Wow!”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Right?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Next, the Leaky Noise case. It was here.”[%18]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Now we overlay the location of the arson fire[...]”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Wait, are you serious?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“And then the love hotel where Revolving Dead happened.”[%18]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“There were also suspicious fires set around the love hotel.”[%18]
[name]Kurusu[line]“They're all concentrated, yeah.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“That's right. Now, as you all know, the Gottsuan Death case took place at our school.”[%18]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“And then when you overlay the locations of the fires—”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“That's kind of amazing.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Right? You can get a better feel for it by looking at the whole map.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Wow[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I was surprised, too, when I first noticed it.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“And in light of all this[...]”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“We can assume that there's some connection between the murders and the arson cases, huh?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Yeah. It's too much of a match to be a coincidence. That woman has some connection to the murders.”[%p]
When I finished, Serika said, “Wow, you're amazing, Taku.”[%p]
But everyone else seemed lost in thought.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Any objections?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“I wouldn't call it an objection, but[...] can I say something?”[%p]
Kurusu raised her head.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Yeah, go ahead.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Well[...]”[%p]
She stood up in such a way as to not put pressure on her injury, and then moved in front of the board.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“I want to check something. The woman who attacked you[...] Her power was—”[%18]
[name]Kurusu[line]“I want to check something. The woman who attacked you[...] Her power was—”[%18]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Huh? That's not right, is it? Are you making fun of me?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“That's not right. What's gotten into you, Takuru?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Yes. Her power lets her control fire, right?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“But none of the murders so far have involved fire, have they?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Um, what was the first one. Don't Look at me?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“And next was Leaky Noise?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“And then Revolving Dead.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“And the one that happened at the school was[...] Gottsuan Death. It's so disgusting to give names like that to murders.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Look. None of them involve fire.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Huh? You're right[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
Kurusu had caught one of the weak points in my argument.[%p]
I'd thought that was strange, too.[%p]
None of the murders had involved fire.[%p]
Which meant that we had very little evidence to suggest that she was the killer.[%18]
[name]Itou[line]“Hey, how about this? Maybe the fire woman was testing her powers or something.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Testing?”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Yeah. She really didn't know what her power was at first, so she started testing different things. That's why each murder is different.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Oh, I see! Shin, you're smart!”[%p]
Serika was impressed, but—[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“But isn't that kind of hard to believe?”[%p]
Arimura said it before I could.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“I-Is it?”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“It just seems like too much of a stretch, I think.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“I think so, too.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Hmm[...] I see.”[%p]
Everyone fell silent.[%p]
We'd only just started, but there was too much we didn't know.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](If she is the killer, then why didn't she use her fire? And why did she kill them like that?)[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](No, wait[...])[%p]
I suddenly got an idea.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Hey, Arimura. I've got a question.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“What is it?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“You were hanging out with Kunosato a lot, right?”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Not because I wanted to.”[%p]
Arimura's disgust was plain. She must've really hated Kunosato.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“She's doing research into psychic powers, right? Did she say anything about the number of powers a Gigalomaniac can have?”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“The number?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Yeah[...] I'd never really thought about it, but is there a rule that a psychic can only have one power?”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Hmm, I don't know. I can tell you that Kunosato never talked about it, though.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“The way real booting works is that, in theory, as long as you could control the delusion properly, you could use any power you wanted.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“In other words, it's possible for a person to have multiple powers.”[%p]
Itou put his hand on his chin and thought.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“So the woman who attacked you two wasn't just a pyrokinetic?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“It's just a possibility, but what do you think?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“That's hardly conclusive.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Then maybe she has a helper, who has a different power?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“A helper? Oh, I get it! So there's more than one person involved.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Or[...] this takes us back to the start, but maybe the pyrokinetic isn't involved in the murders, and the real killer is someone else entirely.”[%18]
[name]Kurusu[line]“In that case, the attack on you was completely unrelated to the murders, right?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
There were too many possibilities to really know what was going on.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Hey, why don't we put this aside for now. We're probably not getting anywhere.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“You're right. Let's leave it for now.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“You told the police about the woman who attacked you, right?”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Yes.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Did they tell you anything?”[%p]
The night we were attacked, we contacted Shinjo and told him what had happened, along with a description of our attacker.[%p]
Arimura had said she'd helped draw a composite sketch, too.[%p]
The police had decided to look for her as a suspect in the arson case. If they could find her, they'd arrest her for that.[%p]
Once they had her in custody, then they could find out if she was responsible for the murders.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“He said he'd call us if he found something, but I haven't heard anything. I don't think they've found who she is.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“I see[...] Then there's nothing else we can say about her.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I think so.”[%p]
My throat was dry from all the talking, so I looked inside my bag.[%p]
Of course, I'd brought a Mountain View.[%p]
I opened it and took a gulp.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Ahhh[...]”[%p]
Everyone else grabbed a drink of their own and took a moment to relax.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Ah[...] Oh, there's a few other things I've been wondering about. Can we talk about them, too?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Sure, let's do it.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“First[...]”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“All the victims were psychics, right? How did the killer find that out?”[%p]
Itou's question was a good one, and one I'd known was coming.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I've got an idea about that.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I think the killer's using the Sumo Stickers to track down their victims.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“The Sumo Stickers?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“More precisely, the 11th Rorschach test. Remember what we saw in the basement of AH Tokyo General? Any psychic who sees that sticker has a very strong reaction.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Arimura and I have both experienced that for ourselves.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Ugh[...] just remembering it makes me feel a little sick.”[%p]
Arimura closed her eyes and put her hand over her mouth. She must've felt like she was going to throw up.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“A-Are you okay, Arimura?”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Y-Yeah. Sorry. Keep going, Miyashiro.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Okay. Itou and Onoe saw this in the basement at the hospital, but they had cameras all over town, watching the stickers.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“They were finding people who had the potential to be psychics to, um[...] experiment on them, underground.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“[...]”[%p]
I could see Kurusu's expression cloud.[%p]
She'd probably remembered her friend, Minamisawa Senri, who'd been a test subject down there.[%p]
It hurt to see her like that, but I decided that I had no choice but to go on anyway.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“So I think the killer might've come from there. If she knew the secret of the stickers, it would be easy to find psychics, right?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“She just had to look for people who had a bad reaction when they saw it.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“For one thing, that woman attacked us when she saw us panicking over the stickers.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Then the killer's using the cameras down there? No way. You need a card key to get in.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“And that place is basically abandoned, right? Nobody was watching the stickers, and nobody was doing any experiments[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“No, even without that facility, they could watch the stickers.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Huh?”[%p]
Kurusu nodded as if she understood.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“I know what Takuru means.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“They didn't have to watch via the cameras. They could just stand near the stickers and go after anyone who reacted like Takuru and Arimura did.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“That's right. I think the pyrokinetic was waiting near the stickers, too. Like a spider waiting for something to wander into its web. And then Arimura and I happened by.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“That would take a long time, though.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“It's not impossible.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“But[...]”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Wait. We won't get any further debating that. Let's go on to the next point.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“We keep leaving questions unanswered. Is that okay?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“We don't have a choice. Our goal right now needs to be to get as many questions out there as we can. Itou, is there anything else that's bothering you?”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Yeah, two more things.”[%p]
Itou asked his two remaining questions.[%p]
Summed up, this is what they were.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Why are the murders taking place on the same day as the New Generation incidents?”[%18]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“And why are they happening at all?”[%18]
[name]Kurusu[line]“It's like the whole point of this is to attract a lot of attention.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
Everything, from the dates to the ways the murders were committed, was chosen to be as sensational as possible.[%p]
Was it just to attract attention, or was it a message meant for a specific person?[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Is that the motive?”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“I know! Like a serial killer, right?”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“They sometimes call those types ‘organized killers.'”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“If the murders continue to follow the dates of the New Generation Madness, the next one will be on the same day as Brain Dead[...] October 23rd.”[%18]
Which also meant nothing was going to happen until then.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“I see! So that's why!”[%p]
Itou suddenly snapped his fingers, as if he'd reached some great conclusion.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]?”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“The two of you were attacked by the pyrokinetic, but in the end, she didn't kill you.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Maybe that's because it wasn't the right day yet.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“The right day?”[%p]
Did that mean it wasn't my power that saved us?[%p]
No, but[...] it had really felt like she was going to kill us.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
The more I thought about it, the more confused I felt.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“All right, I'm going to head to the Student Council, but[...] promise me you won't do anything dangerous when I'm not around, okay?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“You don't need to keep saying that. I know.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Really?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Y-Yeah.”[%p]
It had been a while since Kurusu had glared at me like that.[%p]
Now that the Empress was back, she was scary[...][%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Oh, right. And Takuru[...]”[%p]
Kurusu got in close and whispered to me.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Come back to the Aoba Dorm tonight.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Someone might be after you, right? It's dangerous to be alone.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“It doesn't have to be forever. It can just be for a little while. Live at home until this is resolved.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“No, but[...]”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“No complaints. If you don't come back, I'll come and get you. Bye.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Hey, wait—”[%p]
Before I could say anything, she ran off to the student council room.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](You're the student council president. You shouldn't be running in the hallways.)[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Mmm? What did the vice president say?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“No, nothing[...] some personal stuff.”[%p]
She wanted me to go back to the dorm?[%p]
What should I do?[%p]
There was no real need to listen to her, but knowing Kurusu, she might really come barging into my RV.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“But you know[...] there's just so much we don't understand.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“My head's starting to hurt. Right, Taku?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Taku?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh? Y-Yeah. You're right.”[%p]
We hadn't really learned anything today.[%p]
We had no proof, just a bunch of guesses.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Hey, why don't we talk to Kunosato?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Kunosato, huh?”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“She might know a lot that we don't, right?”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Oh, that's probably a bad idea.”[%p]
Arimura shot down his idea.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Why?”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Didn't I tell you? She doesn't think of us as human.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“She was really mean to you too, right? Or do you get off on that? I can be like that too, if you want.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“I'm really not into that. Don't say the same thing Miyashiro did.”[%p]
Arimura had gotten the same idea about Itou that I had. I laughed a little.[%p]
And then Arimura turned to us with a smile and continued.[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“I'm not kidding. I can tell when people are lying, right?”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Kunosato says a lot of mean things to us[...] but she’s not joking. She really hopes we die.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh[...]?”[%p]
That was a surprise.[%p]
Did she really hate us that much?[%p]
What did we do?[%p]
Arimura continued on, in the same chipper tone a girl might use to discuss after-school plans with a friend.[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“She only sees us as insects she can experiment on. Are you okay with being treated like an insect, Itou?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
After the meeting in the newspaper club ended, I bought a Mountain View at the vending machine in the cafeteria and sat down on a nearby bench.[%p]
I'd been thinking so much that I was exhausted.[%p]
I opened the plastic bottle and swallowed down the bubbling carbonation inside.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Whew.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“You're drinking that stuff again? You really do like it.”[%p]
Itou bought a can of black coffee and sat down on the bench with me.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“You know, that really surprised me back there.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Your power.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Well, I'm still surprised myself.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“I was really impressed, I guess. It was cool.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Stop it. I don't exactly want to hear that from another guy.”[%p]
That's something the heroine says to the male lead in a romantic comedy.[%p]
And then the hero falls in love, maybe.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“No, no way.”[%p]
A series of faces flitted through my mind: Serika, with her dopey laugh, the ever-angry Kurusu, Kazuki playing ESO2, and Arimura with her acid tongue.[%p]
But I couldn't imagine starting a romance with any of them.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Aw, come on. I was trying to say something nice to you.”[%p]
Itou threw the empty can at the garbage bin.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Ah, that's good stuff.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“It is not.”[%p]
The garbage can had a lid, and only a small hole to throw the cans in. Of course, there was no way he could get it inside.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Hey, hey, can you do it again?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Do what again?”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Your power, dude.”[%p]
Itou looked around the cafeteria as he spoke, making sure no one was too close.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“What?”[%p]
Was this why he'd thrown the can?[%p]
Fortunately, it was after school and the cafeteria was just about to close, so there weren't many people in the room.[%p]
There were a few groups of people who were probably chattering about nothing important, and a few boys and girls intently reading their books.[%p]
Nobody was paying attention to us.[%p]
I didn't think anyone would see me and make a fuss, but[...][%p]
[name]Itou[line]“So how does your power work, exactly? Is there a limit on how much weight, or how big an object, or how many things you can move?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Hmm, I haven't tested that yet.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Then can you aim precisely? Do you ever move things other than what you mean to?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I haven't tested that yet, either.”[%p]
That was a good point. It would be best to check that stuff.[%p]
What should I do[...][%p]
No, now wasn't a good time.[%p]
I still wasn't used to it, and I was already exhausted. The idea of trying to focus even more didn't appeal to me.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I'm not feeling up to it today. We can do it some other time.”[%p]
I leaned back on the bench and swallowed my Mountain View.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Aw, don't be such a stingy asshole.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Seriously, I'm not trying to be stingy or anything.”[%p]
But it did seem like I'd need to test the limits of my power, like Itou had said.[%p]
I tossed the bottle of Mountain View into the garbage just like Itou had done a moment ago.[%p]
Of course, it didn't even come close. It fell on the floor and started to roll.[%p]
Okay, let's try this.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I'm not doing this for fun. I'm doing it to enhance my power. Got it?”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Yeah, that's what I want to hear.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Also, don't talk while I'm trying to concentrate. If I can't focus, I can't do it.”[%p]
I stared at the can that Itou had just thrown.[%p]
I imagined it flying into the little hole in the garbage can.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
I could see the Di-Sword appear in the corner of my vision.[%p]
I'd gotten pretty good at this part.[%p]
The next part was the hard one.[%p]
I tried to focus on the image in my mind—[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Miyashiro, stop.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
I was interrupted by a quiet yell from Itou.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](What?!)[%p]
Surprised, I turned toward Itou, and then my mouth flew open with shock.[%p]
I hadn't seen them because the vending machine was blocking my view, but two girls were walking up to the bench.[%p]
I saw them and panicked, and tried to shut down my power.[%p]
But that was the worst thing I could've done.[%p]
The coffee can ended up heading toward one of the girls' feet instead of the garbage can.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Crap!)[%p]
She didn't see it coming.[%p]
There was a chance she might slip on it.[%p]
If she hurt herself, it would be my fault.[%p]
What should I do?[%p]
Should I use my power again to stop it?[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Stop, damn it!)[%p]
The second I told it to stop, it changed its course as if a giant hand had come down and smashed it from above.[%p]
It fell to the ground with a huge clatter.[%p]
[name]Students[line]“Eeyah!”[linebreak][parallel]“Hwah!”[%p]
The two girls leapt up at the sudden noise, and then turned toward us.[%p]
When they did, one of their skirts flew up—[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Uwah[...]”[%p]
As the girl spun, she quickly put her hands on her skirt.[%p]
And then our eyes met.[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]“Oh, no[...]”[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]“Wow, you're creepy. What are you staring at?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh!? Oh, no[...] The sound of the can surprised me, is all. I didn't see anything! Um[...]”[%p]
But the two of them glared at me warily, then ran up the stairs.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
W-What was that about?[%p]
Even if it was my fault[...][%p]
I'd saved them from danger.[%p]
And from where I was sitting, I couldn't see anything anyway.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“I see, I see. Blue, huh?”[%p]
I guess he could, though.[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]“Eeyah!”[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]“Watch out—”[%p]
I didn't react quickly enough— and just as I thought, she slipped on the can.[%p]
The girl next to her grabbed her and managed to keep her from slipping.[%p]
But[...][%p]
The girl's skirt flew up—[%p]
And at the last second, she grabbed it before I could see anything.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Uwah!”[%p]
I shouted without thinking, and the two girls turned to look at me.[%p]
W-Wait! I didn't see anything! I couldn't see anything from where I was sitting![%p]
[name]Female Student[line]“Oh, no[...]”[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]“What a piece of shit.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“N-No, it's not like that! It was an accident. I didn't mean to see! And I didn't even get to see.”[%p]
But the two of them stared at me in disgust and pressed down hard on their skirts, then ran up the stairs toward the classrooms.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]”[%p]
Wh-What was that about? I didn't see anything.[%p]
And if you don't want anyone seeing your panties, maybe don't wear such a short skirt?[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Hmm, hmm[...] blue, huh?”[%p]
Itou got a good look, at least.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Anyway[...]”[%p]
Itou got to see what was under her skirt, and I didn't.[%p]
And when they'd turned toward us, he'd looked away with speed that rivaled being a psychic power in its own way, and pretended he'd seen nothing.[%p]
So I was the only one who got branded a pervert.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Hey, Itou[...]”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Wow, that is one hell of a power.”[%p]
I was pissed, but for some reason Itou was looking at me with newfound respect.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“I'm amazed you came up with such a great way to look under girls' skirts. You've got my respect.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“That wasn't intentional.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“What? It wasn't?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“No.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Aw, that sucks.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Go home, man.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“No, no, no. Hear me out.”[%p]
Itou suddenly took on the air of a scientist, and leaned closer toward me.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“You're too close. That's creepy.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Just listen.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“What is it?”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“You have just become the god of male students everywhere.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
What the hell was he talking about?[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Oh, it's Taku and Shin!”[%p]
As I furrowed my brow, Serika came down the stairs toward us.[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“So there you are. I'll get something to drink, too.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Get a Mountain View.”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Hmm? Hmm[...]”[%p]
Serika nodded hesitantly, then put her coins into the vending machine and hit the button for the drink next to the Mountain View, Dr P.[%p]
There was a thud as the bottle dropped into the bottom compartment.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Miyashiro, now!”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Knock the bottle to the floor and roll it.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Wh-Why?”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Just do it. Think of it as practice.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“O-Okay[...]”[%p]
I didn't really know what was going on— but I tried to visualize the bottle Serika was reaching for falling to the floor.[%p]
The Di-Sword was still there in the corner of my eye, and it was easy to send the image into both of their brains.[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Hwah!”[%p]
The bottle flew out of Serika's hand, just like I wanted.[%p]
And it rolled along the floor, just like I'd envisioned.[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Fwah! Wait, wait!”[%p]
Serika stretched her hand out toward the bottle and ran after it.[%p]
—Of course, she was leaning forward.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Wah?!”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Heh. Just like I thought. Pure white lace.”[%p]
From where Itou was looking, he could see her perfectly.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Y-Y-Y-You asshole!”[%p]
If I took a half-step forward, I could probably see it too, but that half-step felt very difficult to take.[%p]
I finally knew what Itou was after, but I couldn't stop the bottle from rolling quickly.[%p]
Serika was running after it, with her hand stretched out and her back toward us.[%p]
I stood up from the bench and moved between Itou and Serika.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“What are you doing, God?!”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Y-Y-Y-Y-You know what I'm doing!”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“You perverted deity! You're trying to have her all to yourself, aren't you?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“D-Don't call me a pervert!”[%p]
As I panicked, I tried to conceal Serika from his field of vision as best I could.[%p]
And then[...][%p]
I heard a cheerful, oblivious voice from behind me.[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Wow, that scared me. It felt like the bottle was alive and running away from me.”[%p]
I turned around, slowly.[%p]
Serika was holding the bottle in both hands, with her usual dopey grin on her face.[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Hmm, if I open this, it's gonna get everywhere, right?”[%p]
Serika walked back toward us as she spoke.[%p]
I tried to stop myself from looking at the hemline of her skirt as it moved.[%p]
When I thought about what I'd just tried to do, and then the way she'd smiled[...] I shook my head vigorously.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Heheheh[...]”[%p]
I heard a laugh from Itou and glared over at him.[%p]
He whistled innocently.[%p]
Trying to hide Serika from his gaze, I imagined something else.[%p]
This time, it was the bottle coming to a dead stop in Serika's hands.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-tahah!”[%p]
I ended up saying something weird, but this time, I used my full powers to stop her.[%p]
But then—[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Oh, hello everyone.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Wait, what are you doing, Seri?”[%p]
[name]Kazuki[line]“Mmm?”[%p]
Kurusu, Arimura, and Kazuki were all coming down the stairs.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Why now, of all times?)[%p]
I became totally distracted.[%p]
And instead of the bottle coming to a stop, I imagined something entirely different.[%p]
It was probably because I'd imagined what Itou had just witnessed— but I ended up thinking about a naughty article I'd just read in Cool Cat Press.[%p]
“How to Take the Girl You Want to Bed: Tell From Her Underwear Whether She's Up for it Tonight!” was the name of the article. It had pictures, too.[%p]
I remembered saying, “If the girl's showing you her underwear, of course she's up for it!” but[...] all the girls were wearing different kinds of underwear.[%p]
After taking a moment to appreciate, from an academic standpoint, the variety of underwear on offer, I started trying to guess what kind of underwear Serika would pick, or maybe Kurusu[...][%p]
No, no! Don't be stupid![%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Don't think about that now!)[%p]
But the more I tried to stop it, the stronger the strange vision became.[%p]
And suddenly, I heard the sound of my destruction.[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Huh?”[%p]
There was a small rustling sound as Arimura's skirt—[%p]
Slowly, but surely and steadily, started to rise.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Uwah!”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Ooh!”[%p]
[center][margin top="242"]It went up past her knee socks, and then higher, and higher[...][evaluate expr="290AA4B5141400810000"][%e]
[name]Arimura[line]“Huh?! Aah!”[%p]
Arimura stood there for a moment in shock, and then realized what was going on and grabbed her skirt from above.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Kazuki[line]“Mmm?”[%p]
Kurusu and Kazuki were looking at her with wide-open eyes.[%p]
Shit, shit, shit![%p]
This wasn't good![%p]
Serika would probably laugh and forgive me. Actually, she might not even realize what had happened.[%p]
But I wouldn't be that lucky with Arimura.[%p]
Any second now she was going to realize it was because of my power.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](And to make matters worse[...])[%p]
I gulped.[%p]
The Empress, now fully recovered, was standing next to her.[%p]
If she figured out what I'd done, who knew what would happen!?[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“What was that? The wind?”[%p]
Y-Y-Yeah! It was the wind![%p]
It was the wind's fault! Not mine![%p]
So I didn't do anything! And it's not my fault! Hahaha![%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](—And that's my only hope!)[%p]
I quickly tried to come up with a new delusion.[%p]
And then transmitted it into everyone's brains![%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Okay!)[%p]
I used my power to softly open a nearby window.[%p]
And nobody noticed. It worked![%p]
It was as if it had been open the whole time.[%p]
All that was left was for the wind to blow through the window, and I should be able to fool them![%p]
Come to think of it, this power of mine is amazing![%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“[...]?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
A soft breeze, just strong enough to barely move your hair, rubbed against my cheek.[%p]
The wind was weak![%p]
It was super weak![%p]
No one else's skirt— neither Kurusu's nor Kazuki's or Serika's— was moving at all.[%p]
Arimura alone had turned beet red, grabbed the hem of her skirt, and started looking frantically around.[%p]
The gap between her behavior and how she normally acted was cute enough that I couldn't help but stare— wait, no![%p]
There was no physical reason for Arimura's uniform to be the only one to rise up like that.[%p]
This wasn't going to fool them at all![%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](I[...] I know!)[%p]
Could my power maybe cause air to convect?[%p]
If it could, there was still hope![%p]
I could just create the wind![%p]
I came up with a new delusion and hit everyone around me with it.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](I just need one strong blast of wind!)[%p]
Imagine a strong wind blowing![%p]
Imagine the air moving violently, creating a gust of wind![%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Eeyah!”[%p]
And then, suddenly, Kurusu's skirt flew up as well![%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Yes! I did it!)[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“The Empress is wearing pink striped ones?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](I[...] I can't believe Kurusu would wear something so cute.)[%p]
[name]Kazuki[line]“Mmm?”[%p]
Now it was Kazuki's turn. The hem of her skirt suddenly flew up![%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Even her panties are ESO2 merchandise?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Put some more effort into your clothing choices!)[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“Hawawah!”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“What's going on?”[%p]
Next was Serika, and then Arimura's skirt flew up again as well.[%p]
Y-Y-Yes! It was a success![%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh, wow. That sure was a strong blast of wind.”[%p]
I ran my fingers through my hair and whispered to myself.[%p]
I was worried there for a moment, but I'd just barely managed to—[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
Another soft breeze, just enough to tickle your eyebrows, brushed my cheek.[%p]
Why is the wind so weak?[%p]
It's too weak![%p]
But I could see the girls' white thighs in front of me, and a more tantalizing sight above them.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](No! That's not it! I don't want to lift up their skirts!)[%p]
Well, no, as a healthy schoolboy, I would be lying if I said I wasn't a little interested. In fact, I wanted to make sure I got a good look so I could remember it later— wait, why do I have to be so honest?[%p]
I screamed at my power to stop.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“N-No! No more!”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“This wind's really weird!”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Wait, is this really the wind?”[%p]
[name]Kazuki[line]“Mmm[...]”[%p]
The girls were clearly suspicious now, and were holding down their skirts with both hands.[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Hey, Miyashiro? Don't you think they're going to catch you?”[%p]
Itou stood up from the bench and started to move backward, afraid. Specifically, afraid of Kurusu.[%p]
And to make matters worse, one of the groups of girls that had been talking in the cafeteria was starting to move closer to us.[%p]
They'd probably run out of things to talk about, and decided to go home— and now they were looking at us in shock.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Shit! Shit! Shit!)[%p]
This was way too suspicious![%p]
They might think that the girls were lifting up their skirts to show us![%p]
If that happened, the whole school might think the newspaper club were a bunch of perverts![%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](What do I do? Should I do it again?)[%p]
As I hesitated, I could hear the group of girls start to whisper.[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]“Hey, what was that?”[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]“Something weird's going on[...]”[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]“Wait, is that the student council president?”[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]“Oh, jeez[...]”[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]“What's going on?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Fine, I'll do it!)[%p]
I focused my mind to its utmost.[%p]
I just need the wind to blow the way I want it![%p]
If the wind blows up their skirts, too, I can fix this misunderstanding! I can avoid any weird rumors![%p]
You know that, right? I'm just gonna check![%p]
Don't just lift up the skirts because I want to see their panties![%p]
Wind blows →→→ Skirts fly up! Don't get the order mixed up![%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Gaaah!)[%p]
With an explosion of mental force, I sent the vision from my brain to the others.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Ooh!)[%p]
That did it! Finally![%p]
A gust of wind blew through the open window.[%p]
The girls' hair started to fly up.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Huh? It's no good?!)[%p]
But the wind still wasn't strong enough![%p]
It wasn't enough to blow up their skirts![%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Then I'll just have to[...])[%p]
I'll add my power to the strength of the wind![%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Haahh—!)[%p]
[name]All[line]“Huh?”[linebreak][parallel]“Hmm?”[linebreak][parallel]“Mmm?”[%p]
Now those girls' skirts flew up, just like Kurusu and the others' had.[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]“Eeyah!”[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]“Wah?!”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](And now this!)[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]“Hey!”[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]“Eek!”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Take this! Once more!)[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]“Hwah!”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Huh?!)[%p]
For some reason, the sound was different with the last girl.[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]“What was that wind?”[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]“Someone left the window open!”[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]“And I think he saw us, too!”[%p]
The girls quickly pressed down on their skirts.[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]“This sucks. I'm not even wearing cute panties today.”[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]“That's not the problem.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“N-N-No! I[...] I didn't see. The wind surprised me.”[%p]
As I whispered excuses, I saw the girl in the back fidgeting.[%p]
Wasn't that the girl who made a slightly different sound?[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]“Mmm? What's wrong?”[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]“F-For some reason, the hook on my bra came undone.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](WHAT?!)[%p]
The hook on her bra?[%p]
What the hell kind of wind does that? What is wrong with my power?[%p]
No, I mean, I did kind of think she had big boobs, but[...] just a little![%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
I suddenly felt a murderous energy, and looked up in shock[...] and my eyes locked with Kurusu, who was looking down upon me with her arms crossed.[%p]
Arimura and Kazuki had their arms crossed, too, and the same cold expressions on their face.[%p]
Serika was the only one who didn't seem to know what had happened. She was looking between me and the others, confused.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Uh[...] uh[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Itou? Hey, Itou?”[%p]
[center][margin top="242"]I turned around in search of my best friend, but there was no one there.[evaluate expr="290AA4B5141400810000"][%e]
Instead, I could see a single shadow outside the window, racing away toward the setting sun.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“I-I-ITOU!”[%p]
My power was psychokinesis.[%p]
If I could use it to affect the atoms in the air[...][%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](N-No, wait. There's no way that'll work.)[%p]
Even if I could technically do it, right now I couldn't move anything more than a soda bottle.[%p]
No, I'd learned from my experiment today that I could move a girl's skirt, which was an achievement in and of itself — No, no, no! I need to find another way.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Wow, that surprised me. What a big gust of wind.”[%p]
Huh?[%p]
Kurusu spoke up as I was trying to decide what to do. Her voice was just a little louder than it needed to be.[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“You're right. Oh, Miyashiro. Did you see?”[%p]
Arimura made a motion like she was wiping dust off her skirt.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“N-N-No[...]”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“I hope not.”[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]“Oh, it was just the wind.”[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]“Was the wind blowing?”[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]“Mmm?”[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]“But the student council president said it was the wind, right? So it probably was.”[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]“You're right.”[%p]
Th-That's Kurusu for you.[%p]
The students trusted her a lot.[%p]
They looked a little confused, but quickly moved on to another topic, then left the room entirely.[%p]
Good. I'm saved.[%p]
We weren't going to be known as a bunch of perverts.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Now, then[...]”[%p]
Kurusu kept smiling until the moment the girls were out of sight. Then she glared at me.[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line](Uwah?!)[%p]
Not good! I'm not saved![%p]
I tried to come up with some way to get out of this situation—[%p]
But in the end, I gave up.[%p]
No matter what I tried, there was no way I'd be able to successfully lie to Arimura. And I'd never been able to fool Kurusu.[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Takuru? Itou? Why don't we have a little chat in the club room?”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“A chat? About what? I have no idea.”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“Itou is lying.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“Oh, crap!”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“You shut up.”[%p]
[center][margin top="280"]Thirty minutes later[...][evaluate expr="290AA4B5141400810000"][%e]
[name]Itou[line]“I'm very sorry!”[%p]
Itou was kneeling on the floor, surrounded by the girls.[%p]
After thirty minutes of a newspaper club inquisition, it was decided that Itou was at fault.[%p]
I'd done some things that weren't very good either, but in the end, I'd managed to make them understand that they were mistakes. Whew[...][%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“You’d really better not do this again, Itou.”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“I'm very sorry. I'll never do it again.”[%p]
Itou bowed so low his face touched the floor.[%p]
That's right! That's right! Get madder![%p]
That's what you get for putting me through that![%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“And anyway, you shouldn't have played along, Takuru. You always get like this whenever somebody gives you a compliment.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Ugh!”[%p]
[name]Arimura[line]“That's right. Miyashiro might not look like it, but he's filled with perverted delusions.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Gwah!”[%p]
[name]Onoe[line]“And he's got a lot of naughty books hidden away.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Haargh!”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Takuru, is that true? Didn't I tell you not to do that?”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“N-No, Onoe's just misunderstanding! I don't have any books like— wait, why are you getting mad at me now?”[%p]
[name]Kazuki[line]“Mmm[...]”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“You, too. Don't look at me that way.”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Ahem. Anyway, listen, you two. From now on, no using your power for weird things. I won't let you. Promise?”[%p]
[name]Itou[line]“I promise!”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“No, I mean, I never wanted to—”[%p]
[name]Kurusu[line]“Promise me.”[%p]
[name]Miyashiro[line]“Okay[...]”[%p]
Itou bowed low on the floor again, and I did, too.[%p]
